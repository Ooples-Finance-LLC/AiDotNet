# ZeroDev - AI-Powered Development System

## 🚀 Transform Ideas into Code

ZeroDev is an AI-powered development system that transforms your ideas into fully functional applications with zero manual coding required. Simply describe what you want to build, and watch as ZeroDev creates it for you.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎯 Beyond Bug Fixing
While ZeroDev includes the powerful BuildFixAgents system for automatic error resolution, it goes far beyond just fixing bugs:

- **Project Generation**: Create entire projects from natural language descriptions
- **Feature Addition**: Add complex features to existing codebases seamlessly
- **Full Development**: Handle the complete development lifecycle from idea to deployment
- **Multi-Language Support**: Works with JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, Go, Rust, and more

## 🏃 Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AiDotNet.git
cd AiDotNet

# Make ZeroDev executable
chmod +x zerodev.sh

# Add to PATH (optional)
echo 'alias zerodev="'$(pwd)'/zerodev.sh"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Basic Usage

#### Create a New Project
```bash
zerodev new "Create a REST API for managing a library of books with user authentication"
```

#### Add Features to Existing Project
```bash
cd my-project
zerodev add "Add real-time chat functionality with WebSocket support"
```

#### Fix Build Errors (Classic Mode)
```bash
zerodev fix
```

#### Full Development from Idea
```bash
zerodev develop "Build an e-commerce platform with product catalog, shopping cart, and payment integration"
```

## 🎨 Example Use Cases

### 1. API Development
```bash
zerodev new "Create a RESTful API for a task management system"
```
**Generates**:
- Complete Express.js/FastAPI project structure
- CRUD endpoints for tasks
- User authentication
- Database models
- API documentation
- Docker configuration

### 2. Web Application
```bash
zerodev develop "Build a blog platform with markdown support and comments"
```
**Creates**:
- Full-stack application
- React/Vue frontend
- Node.js/Python backend
- Database schema
- Authentication system
- Responsive UI

### 3. Feature Enhancement
```bash
zerodev add "Add OAuth2 authentication with Google and GitHub"
```
**Implements**:
- OAuth2 integration
- User profile management
- Session handling
- Security best practices

## 🛠️ How It Works

### Multi-Agent Architecture
ZeroDev uses a sophisticated multi-agent system where specialized agents handle different aspects of development:

1. **Architect Agent**: Designs system architecture
2. **Project Generator**: Creates project structure and boilerplate
3. **Feature Implementation Agent**: Adds new features to existing code
4. **Developer Agents**: Write actual code implementation
5. **Testing Agent**: Creates and runs tests
6. **Documentation Agent**: Generates comprehensive docs

### Intelligent Context Understanding
- Automatically detects project type and structure
- Understands existing code patterns
- Maintains consistency with your coding style
- Integrates seamlessly with existing codebases

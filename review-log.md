## Phase 2: New Features

### [NF-001] - Implement Gradient-Based Neural Architecture Search (DARTS)
- **Agent**: TBD
- **Branch**: TBD
- **PR**: TBD
- **Status**: NOT_STARTED
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: X-Large (3+ days)
- **User Story**: ~/.claude/user-stories/AiDotNet/new_features/NF-001-gradient-based-nas.md
- **Checklist**: Not yet started

- **Agent**: TBD
- **Branch**: TBD
- **PR**: TBD
- **Status**: NOT_STARTED
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: Large (3-5 days)
- **User Story**: ~/.claude/user-stories/AiDotNet/code_improvements/CI-001-remove-generic-constraints.md
- **Checklist**: Not yet started

## Summary

**Total User Stories**: 2
- Phase 1 (Bug Fixes): 0
- Phase 2 (New Features): 1
- Phase 3 (Code Improvements): 1

**Overall Status**:
- Not Started: 2
- In Progress: 0
- Completed: 0
- Failed: 0

**Next Steps**:
1. Review priority recommendation (index.md suggests CI-001 before NF-001)
2. Await user approval to begin Phase 2 or Phase 3
3. Launch analysis agents for approved phase

## Notes

- Index recommends starting with CI-001 for architectural consistency
- CI-001 removes generic constraints to align with INumericOperations<T> pattern
- NF-001 implements DARTS gradient-based neural architecture search
- Both stories are High priority

  - "Performance should be fast"
  - "Interface should be intuitive"

### 5. Feasibility Check ⚠️
**Concerns**:
- NFR1.3: 10k concurrent users with current budget
- FR3.5: Real-time sync across regions
- NFR2.4: 100% audit coverage

### 6. Traceability Check ✓
- Business needs traced: 100%
- Technical requirements traced: 87%
- Test cases linked: 78%

## Detailed Findings

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
1. **Conflicting Security Requirements**
   - Issue: Password rules conflict between FR and NFR
   - Impact: Implementation confusion
   - Resolution: Align on single standard

2. **Impossible Performance Target**
   - Issue: <10ms response for complex queries
   - Impact: Cannot be achieved
   - Resolution: Revise to realistic target

3. **Missing Acceptance Criteria**
   - Issue: 22 requirements lack criteria
   - Impact: Cannot verify completion
   - Resolution: Add specific criteria

### Major Issues (Should Fix)
1. Duplicate requirements (4 instances)
2. Vague success metrics (8 instances)
3. Missing error scenarios (12 instances)
4. Incomplete dependencies (6 instances)

### Minor Issues (Could Fix)
1. Formatting inconsistencies
2. Naming convention violations
3. Missing examples
4. Outdated references

## Cross-Reference Analysis

### Requirement Dependencies
```
Authentication (FR1.*) 
    └── Required by: All other features
    
API Development (FR3.*)
    └── Required by: Mobile apps, integrations
    
Performance (NFR1.*)
    └── Impacts: All user-facing features
    
Security (NFR2.*)
    └── Impacts: All data operations
```

### Circular Dependencies Found
- None identified

### Orphaned Requirements
- TR2.4: References non-existent feature
- NFR3.6: No linking functional requirement

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Resolve conflicting requirements
2. Add missing acceptance criteria
3. Clarify ambiguous terms
4. Update feasibility assessments

### Process Improvements
1. Implement requirement templates

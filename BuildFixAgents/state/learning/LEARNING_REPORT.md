## Success Rate by Error Type



## Key Learnings

1. **Most Successful Fixes**
   - File modification system working well for CS0101 (duplicate classes)
   - State management improvements reducing cache issues
   
2. **Areas Needing Improvement**
   - Complex inheritance issues (CS0462) need better analysis
   - Missing type resolution could use AI assistance
   
3. **Performance Insights**
   - Build operations are the main bottleneck
   - Caching significantly improves performance
   - Parallel agent execution saves time

## Recommended Improvements

### High Priority
1. Implement smart caching for build results
2. Add more sophisticated duplicate detection
3. Expand pattern library with edge cases

### Medium Priority
1. Add machine learning for pattern prediction
2. Implement A/B testing for fix strategies
3. Create feedback loop for user corrections

### Low Priority
1. Add visualization for success rates
2. Create pattern recommendation engine
3. Implement automated pattern generation

## Self-Improvement Actions

1. **Pattern Enhancement**
   - Analyze failed fixes to identify missing patterns
   - Update pattern library with learned solutions
   - Test patterns in sandbox before deployment

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Cache frequently accessed data
   - Optimize file I/O operations
   - Implement lazy loading for patterns

3. **Error Prevention**
   - Predict likely errors based on code patterns
   - Suggest preventive refactoring
   - Create error avoidance guidelines

## Next Learning Cycle

- Collect more data on edge cases
- Test alternative fix strategies
- Measure long-term success rates
- Update confidence thresholds

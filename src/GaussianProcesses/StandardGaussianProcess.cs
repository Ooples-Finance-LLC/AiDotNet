/// a range of possible lines with a confidence level for each. This helps you understand not just

/// Gaussian Processes are particularly useful when:
/// - You have a small to medium amount of data
/// - You need to know how confident the model is in its predictions
/// - Your data might have complex patterns that simpler models can't capture

/// A genetic algorithm is an AI technique inspired by natural evolution - it creates a "population" of possible 
/// solutions, selects the best ones, and combines them to create new solutions, similar to how animals evolve 
/// through natural selection.
/// 
/// Two important settings in genetic algorithms are:
/// - Crossover rate: How often solutions are combined to create new ones (like breeding)
/// - Mutation rate: How often random changes are introduced to solutions (like genetic mutations)
/// 
/// This class helps the algorithm perform better by automatically adjusting these rates based on whether
/// the algorithm is making progress or getting stuck.

    /// Imagine you're trying to find the best recipe for a cake. If your latest attempt tastes better than 
    /// the previous one, you might want to:
    /// - Make more small variations of your successful recipe (increase crossover)
    /// - Make fewer random changes (decrease mutation)
    /// 
    /// But if your latest cake tastes worse, you might want to:
    /// - Try more different approaches (decrease crossover)
    /// - Make more random changes to escape the bad recipe (increase mutation)
    /// 
    /// That's exactly what this method does for the genetic algorithm:
    /// 
    /// 1. It compares the current result (fitness score) with the previous one
    /// 2. If things are improving, it adjusts the settings to focus more on refining good solutions
    /// 3. If things are getting worse, it adjusts the settings to explore more diverse solutions
    /// 4. It always makes sure the settings stay within reasonable limits
    /// 
    /// This adaptive approach helps the algorithm work better across different problems without
    /// requiring manual tuning.

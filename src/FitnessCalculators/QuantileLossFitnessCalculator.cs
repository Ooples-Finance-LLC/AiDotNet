/// <summary>
/// A fitness calculator that uses Quantile Loss to evaluate model performance, particularly for prediction tasks 
/// where you want to estimate specific quantiles of the target distribution.

/// <typeparam name="T">The numeric type used for calculations (e.g., double, float).</typeparam>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> This calculator helps evaluate how well your model is performing when you want to predict
/// a specific percentile of your data rather than just the average value.
/// 
/// Quantile Loss is designed specifically for problems where:
/// - You're interested in predicting a specific percentile (like the median or 90th percentile)
/// - You want to account for asymmetric risks (where over-prediction and under-prediction have different costs)
/// - You need to make predictions that reflect uncertainty in your data
/// 
/// What is a quantile?
/// A quantile divides your data into equal portions:
/// - The 0.5 quantile (50th percentile) is the median - half the values are above it, half below
/// - The 0.9 quantile (90th percentile) is the value below which 90% of observations fall
/// - The 0.1 quantile (10th percentile) is the value below which 10% of observations fall
/// 
/// Examples of when to use Quantile Loss:
/// - Predicting delivery times (where late deliveries might be more costly than early ones)
/// - Estimating sales (where underestimating inventory needs might be worse than overestimating)
/// - Forecasting energy demand (where underestimating could lead to blackouts)
/// - Predicting financial risk (where you want to know the worst-case scenario at a certain confidence level)
/// 
/// How Quantile Loss works:
/// - It penalizes under-predictions and over-predictions differently based on the quantile you choose
/// - For the median (0.5 quantile), it penalizes both equally (this is also called the Mean Absolute Error)
/// - For higher quantiles (>0.5), it penalizes under-predictions more heavily
/// - For lower quantiles (<0.5), it penalizes over-predictions more heavily
/// 
/// Think of it like this:
/// Imagine you're predicting package delivery times:
/// - If you use the 0.5 quantile (median), you're predicting when half the packages will arrive
/// - If you use the 0.9 quantile, you're predicting a time by which 90% of packages will arrive
///   (useful for giving customers a "delivered by" guarantee)
/// - If you use the 0.1 quantile, you're predicting when the earliest 10% of packages will arrive
/// 
/// Key characteristics:
/// - It allows for asymmetric penalties on errors
/// - Lower values are better (0 would be perfect predictions)
/// - The default quantile is 0.5 (the median)
/// - Different quantiles give you different insights about your predictions
/// </para>

    /// Parameters:
    /// - quantile: Which percentile you want to predict (between 0 and 1)
    ///   * 0.5 means the median (middle value) - this is the default
    ///   * 0.9 means the 90th percentile (value below which 90% of data falls)

    /// When to use different quantiles:
    /// - Use 0.5 (median) when over-predictions and under-predictions are equally bad
    /// - Use higher quantiles (like 0.9) when under-predictions are more costly
    ///   (e.g., when underestimating how much inventory you need)
    /// - Use lower quantiles (like 0.1) when over-predictions are more costly
    ///   (e.g., when overestimating revenue could lead to poor business decisions)

    /// It works by comparing your model's predictions to the actual values, but with a twist:
    /// - It penalizes under-predictions and over-predictions differently based on the quantile you chose
    /// - For the median (0.5 quantile), it treats both types of errors equally
    /// - For higher quantiles (>0.5), it penalizes under-predictions more heavily

    /// - The cost of over-prediction and under-prediction is different
    /// - You need to make predictions at specific percentiles (like the 90th percentile)
    /// - You want to capture the uncertainty in your predictions
    /// 
    /// For example:
    /// - If predicting delivery times, a 0.9 quantile loss would help ensure 90% of deliveries arrive on time
    /// - If predicting sales, a 0.1 quantile loss would give you a conservative estimate to avoid overstocking

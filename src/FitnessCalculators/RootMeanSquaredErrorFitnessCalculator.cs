/// <summary>
/// A fitness calculator that uses Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate model performance.

/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> This calculator helps evaluate how well your model is performing by measuring
/// the average size of the errors in your predictions, with a special emphasis on larger errors.
/// 
/// Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is one of the most commonly used metrics in machine learning and is:
/// - A measure of how far off your predictions are from the actual values
/// - Calculated by taking the square root of the average of squared differences between predictions and actual values
/// - Expressed in the same units as your target variable (which makes it easy to interpret)
/// 
/// How RMSE works:
/// 1. Calculate the difference between each predicted value and the actual value
/// 2. Square each of these differences (to make all values positive and emphasize larger errors)
/// 3. Calculate the average (mean) of these squared differences
/// 4. Take the square root of this average to get back to the original units
/// 
/// Think of it like this:
/// Imagine you're predicting house prices in dollars:
/// - If your RMSE is $50,000, it means your predictions are off by about $50,000 on average
/// - But because of the squaring step, being off by $100,000 on one house is penalized more than
///   being off by $50,000 on two houses
/// 
/// Key characteristics of RMSE:
/// - Lower values are better (0 would be perfect predictions)
/// - It penalizes larger errors more heavily than smaller ones
/// - It's sensitive to outliers (a few very bad predictions can significantly increase RMSE)
/// - It's in the same units as your target variable (making it easy to understand)
/// 
/// When to use RMSE:
/// - When you want to heavily penalize large errors
/// - When outliers in your predictions should be considered important
/// - When you want a metric that's in the same units as your target variable
/// - For regression problems (predicting continuous values like prices, temperatures, etc.)
/// 
/// RMSE is one of the most popular metrics for regression tasks because it provides a clear,
/// interpretable measure of prediction error in the original units of the target variable.

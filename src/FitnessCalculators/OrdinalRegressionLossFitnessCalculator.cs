/// <summary>

/// <typeparam name="T">The numeric type used for calculations (e.g., double, float).</typeparam>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> This calculator helps evaluate how well your model is performing on ordinal classification tasks,
/// which are a special type of classification where the categories have a meaningful order or rank.
/// 
/// Ordinal Regression Loss is designed specifically for problems where:
/// - You're predicting categories that have a natural order
/// - The distance between categories matters
/// - You want to penalize predictions that are further from the true category more heavily
/// 
/// Examples of ordinal classification problems:
/// - Rating predictions (1-5 stars)
/// - Education levels (elementary, middle, high school, college)
/// - Customer satisfaction levels (very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, neutral, satisfied, very satisfied)
/// - Disease severity (mild, moderate, severe)
/// 
/// How Ordinal Regression Loss works:
/// - It recognizes that predicting a 4 when the true value is 5 is better than predicting a 1
/// - It penalizes predictions based on how far they are from the true category
/// - It takes into account the ordered nature of your categories
/// 
/// Think of it like this:
/// Imagine you're predicting movie ratings (1-5 stars):
/// - Predicting 4 stars when the actual rating is 5 stars is a small error
/// - Predicting 1 star when the actual rating is 5 stars is a large error
/// - Ordinal Regression Loss will penalize the second error much more heavily
/// 
/// Key characteristics:
/// - It's specifically designed for ordered categories
/// - It penalizes errors based on the distance between predicted and actual categories
/// - Lower values are better (0 would be perfect predictions)
/// - It can automatically detect if your problem is suitable for ordinal regression
/// 
/// This calculator is smart enough to:
/// - Use ordinal regression loss when appropriate
/// - Fall back to other loss functions when your data doesn't fit the ordinal pattern

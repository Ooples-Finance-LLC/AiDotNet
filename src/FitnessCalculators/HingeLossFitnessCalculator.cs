/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> This calculator helps evaluate how well your model is performing on classification tasks,
/// especially when you're trying to clearly separate two classes from each other.
/// 
/// Hinge Loss is commonly used with Support Vector Machines (SVMs), which are models that try to find
/// the best dividing line (or "hyperplane") between different classes of data.
/// 
/// How Hinge Loss works:
/// - It penalizes predictions that are both incorrect AND confident
/// - It doesn't care how correct your correct predictions are, only that they're on the right side of the boundary
/// - It creates a "margin" around the decision boundary and wants predictions to be clearly on one side or the other
/// 
/// Think of it like this:
/// Imagine you're trying to separate apples and oranges on a table with a stick.
/// - Hinge Loss doesn't just want the stick to separate them
/// - It wants all apples to be at least a certain distance from the stick on one side
/// - And all oranges to be at least a certain distance from the stick on the other side
/// 
/// This creates a "safety margin" that makes the model more robust.
/// 
/// Common applications include:
/// - Text classification (like spam detection)
/// - Image classification
/// - Any binary classification problem where you want a clear separation between classes

    /// <b>For Beginners:</b> This method calculates how well your model is performing using Hinge Loss.
    /// 
    /// It works by:
    /// 1. Taking the predictions your model made
    /// 2. Comparing them to the actual correct answers
    /// 3. Calculating a score that represents how wrong the model was, with special attention to:
    ///    - Whether predictions are on the correct side of the decision boundary
    ///    - Whether they're far enough from the boundary (in the "margin")
    /// 
    /// A lower score means better performance (0 would be perfect).
    /// 
    /// For binary classification:
    /// - Predictions should be in the range [-1, 1] or [0, 1]
    /// - Actual values should be either -1/1 or 0/1 depending on the format
    /// 
    /// This method uses the NeuralNetworkHelper to do the actual Hinge Loss calculation,

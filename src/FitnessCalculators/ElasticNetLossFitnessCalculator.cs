/// <b>For Beginners:</b> This calculator helps you evaluate how well your model is performing while also encouraging it to be simpler.
/// 
/// Elastic Net Loss combines two approaches to keep your model from becoming too complex:
/// 1. It measures how well your predictions match the actual values (like other loss functions)
/// 2. It adds penalties for having too many or too large parameters in your model
/// 
/// Think of it like building a bridge:
/// - You want the bridge to be strong enough to do its job (make good predictions)
/// - But you also want to use as few materials as possible (keep the model simple)
/// - Elastic Net helps you find this balance
/// 
/// Some common applications include:
/// - Financial predictions where you want to identify only the most important factors
/// - Medical models where you need to know which few symptoms are most predictive
/// - Any situation where you have many potential input features but want to use only the most important ones
/// 
/// Elastic Net is particularly useful when you have many input features that might be related to each other,
/// as it helps select the most important ones while reducing the impact of less important or redundant features.

    /// 
    /// The method works by:
    /// 1. Calculating how far off your predictions are from the actual values
    /// 2. Adding penalties based on the size and number of parameters in your model
    /// 3. Combining these into a single score where lower values are better
    /// 
    /// The penalties help prevent "overfitting," which is when a model performs well on training data
    /// but poorly on new data because it's too complex and has essentially memorized the training data
    /// rather than learning general patterns.

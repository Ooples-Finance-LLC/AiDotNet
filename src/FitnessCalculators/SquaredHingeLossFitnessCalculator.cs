/// <b>For Beginners:</b> This calculator helps evaluate how well your model is performing on classification tasks,
/// especially when you're trying to decide if something belongs to a category or not (binary classification).
/// 
/// Squared Hinge Loss is a variation of Hinge Loss that puts even more emphasis on getting predictions right.
/// 
/// How Squared Hinge Loss works:
/// - It expects predictions to be either -1 (for negative class) or +1 (for positive class)
/// - It wants predictions to be not just correct, but confident (with a margin of safety)
/// - It penalizes incorrect or uncertain predictions by squaring the error, which makes larger errors much more significant
/// 
/// Think of it like this:
/// Imagine you're a teacher grading true/false questions:
/// - Students get full credit for being confidently correct
/// - Students lose points for being wrong or uncertain
/// - The more confidently wrong they are, the exponentially more points they lose
/// 
/// Compared to regular Hinge Loss:
/// - Regular Hinge Loss increases penalties linearly for wrong predictions
/// - Squared Hinge Loss increases penalties quadratically (much faster) for wrong predictions
/// - This makes Squared Hinge Loss more sensitive to outliers and large errors
/// 
/// Common applications include:
/// - Email spam detection
/// - Sentiment analysis (positive/negative)
/// - Medical diagnosis (presence/absence of a condition)
/// - Any binary classification problem where you want to strongly penalize misclassifications

    /// 
    /// It works by:
    /// 1. Taking the predictions your model made
    /// 2. Comparing them to the actual correct answers
    /// 3. For each prediction:
    ///    - If the prediction is correct and confident: No penalty
    ///    - If the prediction is wrong or not confident enough: Apply a squared penalty
    /// 4. Average all these penalties to get the final score
    /// 
    /// A lower score means better performance (0 would be perfect).
    /// 
    /// This method uses the NeuralNetworkHelper to do the actual Squared Hinge Loss calculation,
    /// passing in your model's predictions and the actual values.
    /// 
    /// Squared Hinge Loss is particularly useful when you want your model to be very confident
    /// in its predictions and you want to strongly penalize any mistakes.

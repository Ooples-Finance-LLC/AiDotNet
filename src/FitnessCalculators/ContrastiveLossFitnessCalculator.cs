/// <b>For Beginners:</b> This calculator helps you evaluate how well your model is learning to determine if two items are similar or different.

/// Contrastive Loss is used in "similarity learning" - a type of machine learning where the goal is to learn 
/// which items are similar and which are different. Some common applications include:
/// 
/// - Face recognition (are these two photos of the same person?)
/// - Signature verification (did the same person sign both documents?)
/// - Product recommendations (finding similar products)
/// - Duplicate detection (finding duplicate documents or images)
/// 
/// The loss function works by:
/// - Pulling similar items closer together in the feature space
/// - Pushing dissimilar items farther apart, up to a certain distance (called the "margin")
/// 
/// Think of it like organizing a classroom: you want students working on the same project to sit close together,
/// while students working on different projects should sit at least a certain distance apart.

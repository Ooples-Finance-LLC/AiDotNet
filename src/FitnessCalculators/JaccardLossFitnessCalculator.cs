/// <summary>

/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> This calculator helps evaluate how well your model is performing on tasks where
/// you need to identify regions or categories, especially when you care about the overlap between
/// your predictions and the actual answers.
/// 
/// Jaccard Loss is based on the Jaccard Index (also called Intersection over Union or IoU),
/// which measures the similarity between two sets by comparing what they have in common
/// versus their combined elements.
/// 
/// How Jaccard Loss works:
/// - It calculates how much your prediction and the actual answer overlap
/// - It divides this overlap by the total area covered by both
/// - It then converts this similarity score into a loss (by subtracting from 1)
/// 
/// Think of it like this:
/// Imagine you and a friend are each drawing circles on a piece of paper:
/// - The Jaccard Index measures how much your circles overlap compared to their total area
/// - A score of 1 means perfect overlap (identical circles)
/// - A score of 0 means no overlap at all
/// - Jaccard Loss is simply 1 minus this score (so 0 is perfect, 1 is terrible)
/// 
/// Common applications include:
/// - Image segmentation (identifying regions in images)
/// - Object detection
/// - Multi-class classification
/// - Any task where you care about the overlap between predicted and actual regions

    /// <b>For Beginners:</b> This method calculates how well your model is performing using Jaccard Loss.
    /// 
    /// It works by:
    /// 1. Taking the predictions your model made
    /// 2. Comparing them to the actual correct answers
    /// 3. Calculating how much they overlap divided by their combined area
    /// 4. Converting this to a loss score (1 - overlap ratio)
    /// 
    /// A lower score means better performance (0 would be perfect).
    /// 
    /// For classification tasks:
    /// - Predictions should typically be probabilities (values between 0 and 1)
    /// - Actual values should be binary (0 or 1)
    /// 
    /// For segmentation tasks:
    /// - Both predictions and actual values represent regions (often as binary masks)
    /// 
    /// This method uses the NeuralNetworkHelper to do the actual Jaccard Loss calculation,
    /// passing in your model's predictions and the actual values.
    /// 
    /// Jaccard Loss is particularly useful when you care about the exact regions or categories
    /// your model is identifying, rather than just whether it's generally correct.

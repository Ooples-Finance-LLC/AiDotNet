/// For Beginners: Interpolation is like "filling in the blanks" between known data points. 
/// Imagine you have temperature readings from several weather stations across a city, and you 
/// want to estimate the temperature at locations between these stations. Interpolation methods 
/// are different mathematical techniques to make these estimates.
/// 
/// Each method has different strengths:
/// - Some are faster but less accurate
/// - Some preserve certain properties of your data better than others
/// - Some work better for smooth data, others for data with sharp changes
/// 
/// The right choice depends on your specific data and what properties you want to preserve.

    /// For Beginners: Bilinear interpolation is like drawing straight lines between your known points

    /// 
    /// Think of it as:
    /// - The simplest and fastest method
    /// - Like stretching a flat sheet over your data points
    /// - Good for when you need quick results and don't need perfect smoothness
    /// - Similar to how a low-resolution image looks when zoomed in

    /// Best used when:
    /// - Speed is more important than accuracy

    /// For Beginners: Bicubic interpolation creates a smoother surface than bilinear by using curved lines 
    /// instead of straight lines between points.
    /// 
    /// Think of it as:
    /// - Like bilinear, but with curves that create smoother transitions
    /// - Similar to how high-quality image resizing works

    /// Best used when:
    /// - You need smoother results than bilinear provides
    /// - Working with data that should be continuous and smooth
    /// - Resizing images or other grid data with better quality

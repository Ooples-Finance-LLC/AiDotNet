/// For Beginners: Time series decomposition is like breaking down a complex song into its individual instruments.
/// 
/// When analyzing data that changes over time (like stock prices, temperature readings, or website traffic),
/// it's often helpful to separate the data into simpler components to better understand what's happening.
/// 
/// For example, retail sales data might contain:
/// - A general upward trend due to business growth
/// - Seasonal patterns (higher sales during holidays)
/// - Random fluctuations due to unpredictable factors
/// 
/// Decomposing the data helps you see each of these patterns separately, making it easier to:
/// - Understand what's driving changes in your data
/// - Make better forecasts
/// - Identify unusual events or anomalies

    /// The Residual component (sometimes called "noise" or "error") represents the random, unpredictable fluctuations

    /// Examples of what might cause residuals:
    /// - Unexpected events (like a surprise promotion causing a sales spike)
    /// - Measurement errors
    /// - Random consumer behavior
    /// - Small factors that individually aren't significant enough to model
    ///

    /// - Check if your decomposition captured all important patterns
    /// - Identify unusual events or outliers
    /// - Assess the randomness and unpredictability in your data

    /// For Beginners: The Cycle component represents repeating patterns that don't have a fixed time period.
    /// 
    /// Unlike seasonality (which occurs at fixed intervals like every December), cycles have varying lengths:
    /// - Business cycles (boom and bust) might last 2-10 years
    /// - Housing market cycles might expand and contract over varying timeframes
    /// - Sunspot activity follows cycles of approximately 11 years, but the exact length varies

    /// Think of cycles as repeating patterns where you can't precisely predict when the next one will occur.

    /// but keeping both the long-term direction and medium-term fluctuations.

    /// For Beginners: IMF stands for Intrinsic Mode Function, which is a special type of component extracted 
    /// using a technique called Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD).
    /// 
    /// Unlike traditional decomposition that separates data into trend, seasonality, and residuals, EMD breaks 
    /// down the data into a collection of IMFs, each representing oscillations at different time scales.
    /// 
    /// Think of IMFs as layers of waves with different frequencies:
    /// - Lower-order IMFs (IMF1, IMF2) capture fast oscillations (high-frequency components)
    /// - Higher-order IMFs capture slower oscillations (low-frequency components)
    /// - The final residual typically represents the overall trend
    /// 
    /// EMD and IMFs are particularly useful for:
    /// - Analyzing non-linear and non-stationary time series
    /// - Data where patterns change over time
    /// - Complex signals with multiple overlapping cycles
    /// 
    /// This approach is more advanced but can reveal patterns that traditional decomposition methods might miss.

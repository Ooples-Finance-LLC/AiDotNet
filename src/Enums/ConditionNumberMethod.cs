/// <summary>
/// Specifies different methods for calculating the condition number of a matrix.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> The condition number is a measure of how sensitive a matrix is to changes in input.
/// 
/// Think of it like checking how stable a table is - a table with uneven legs (high condition number) 
/// will wobble a lot with small changes, while a stable table (low condition number) remains steady.
/// 
/// In machine learning and numerical computing:
/// - A low condition number (close to 1) indicates a "well-conditioned" matrix that produces reliable results
/// - A high condition number indicates an "ill-conditioned" matrix that might amplify small errors
/// - An infinite condition number means the matrix is singular (cannot be inverted)
/// 
/// This is important because ill-conditioned matrices can cause numerical problems in algorithms,
/// leading to inaccurate results or slow convergence.

    /// <b>For Beginners:</b> SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) is a way to break down a matrix into three simpler matrices.
    /// 
    /// Using SVD, the condition number is calculated as the ratio of the largest singular value to the smallest non-zero singular value.
    /// 
    /// Advantages:
    /// - Most accurate method
    /// - Works for any matrix shape (not just square matrices)
    /// - Provides the standard definition of the condition number
    /// 
    /// Limitations:
    /// - Computationally expensive for large matrices
    /// - Requires more memory than other methods
    /// 
    /// This is generally the preferred method when accuracy is important and the matrix is not too large.

    /// <b>For Beginners:</b> The L1 norm condition number uses the sum of absolute values in each column to estimate how sensitive the matrix is.

    /// Advantages:
    /// - Faster to compute than SVD

    /// - Easier to understand conceptually
    /// 
    /// Limitations:
    /// - Less accurate than SVD
    /// - Only works for square matrices

    /// Instead of calculating everything exactly, it uses repeated multiplication to converge to an estimate.
    /// Think of it like repeatedly zooming in on the most important parts of the matrix.
    /// 
    /// Advantages:
    /// - Much faster for very large matrices
    /// - Uses less memory than SVD
    /// - Can provide a good approximation with fewer calculations
    /// 
    /// Limitations:
    /// - Only provides an estimate, not the exact condition number
    /// - May require many iterations to converge
    /// - May not converge well for certain types of matrices

    /// This method is particularly useful for large-scale problems where SVD would be too computationally expensive.

/// Implements a standard cross-validation strategy for model evaluation.

/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// This class provides a standard implementation of cross-validation, a technique used to assess how the results of a 
/// statistical analysis will generalize to an independent data set. It is particularly important in contexts where the goal 
/// is prediction, and one wants to estimate how accurately a predictive model will perform in practice.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Cross-validation is like a thorough test for your machine learning model.
/// 
/// What this class does:
/// - Splits your data into several parts (called folds)
/// - Trains and tests your model multiple times, each time using a different part as the test set
/// - Calculates how well your model performs on average across all these tests
/// 
/// This is useful because:
/// - It helps you understand how well your model will work on new, unseen data
/// - It can detect if your model is overfitting (memorizing the training data instead of learning general patterns)
/// - It provides a more reliable estimate of your model's performance than a single train-test split
/// 
/// For example, if you're building a model to predict house prices, cross-validation would test it on different subsets 
/// of your house data, giving you a better idea of how well it will predict prices for houses it hasn't seen before.

    /// - Gets the right math operations for the type of numbers you're using (like addition, multiplication, etc.)
    /// - This allows the cross-validator to work with different types of numbers without changing its code

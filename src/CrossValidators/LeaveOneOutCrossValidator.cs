/// This class provides a Leave-One-Out cross-validation implementation, where each data point is used once as the validation set
/// while the remaining data points form the training set.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Leave-One-Out cross-validation is like testing your model on each data point individually.
/// 
/// What this class does:
/// - For each data point in your dataset:
///   - Uses that single point for testing
///   - Uses all other points for training
/// - Repeats this process for every single data point
/// - Calculates how well your model performs on average across all these tests
/// 
/// This is useful because:
/// - It uses almost all of your data for training in each iteration
/// - It gives you a performance estimate for each individual data point
/// - It's particularly useful for small datasets
/// 
/// However, it can be computationally expensive for large datasets.

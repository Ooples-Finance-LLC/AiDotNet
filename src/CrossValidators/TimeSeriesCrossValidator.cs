/// This class provides a time series cross-validation implementation, which respects the temporal order of the data.
/// It uses an expanding window approach, where the training set grows over time.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Time series cross-validation is designed for data that has a time component.
/// 
/// What this class does:
/// - Starts with a small portion of your data for training
/// - Uses the next part for validation
/// - Expands the training set to include the previous validation set
/// - Repeats this process, moving forward in time
/// - Calculates how well your model performs on average across all these tests
/// 
/// This is useful because:
/// - It respects the time order of your data
/// - It simulates how the model would perform in a real-world scenario where you use past data to predict the future
/// - It helps detect if your model's performance changes over time

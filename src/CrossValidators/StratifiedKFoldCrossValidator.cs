/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// This class provides a stratified k-fold cross-validation implementation, where the data is split into k folds
/// while maintaining the proportion of samples for each class.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Stratified k-fold cross-validation is like k-fold, but it ensures that each fold
/// has roughly the same proportion of different types of data as the whole dataset.
/// 
/// What this class does:
/// - Splits your data into k parts (folds), maintaining the balance of different classes in each fold
/// - Uses each part once for testing and the rest for training
/// - Repeats this process k times, so each part gets a chance to be the test set
/// - Calculates how well your model performs on average across all these tests
/// 
/// This is particularly useful when:
/// - Your data has imbalanced classes (some types of data are much more common than others)
/// - You want to ensure each fold is representative of the overall dataset
/// </para>

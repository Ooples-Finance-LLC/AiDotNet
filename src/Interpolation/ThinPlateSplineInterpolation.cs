/// Thin Plate Spline (TPS) is a technique for interpolating smooth surfaces through scattered data points
/// in two dimensions. It minimizes the "bending energy" of the surface, creating a result that is
/// analogous to the shape a thin metal plate would take if forced to pass through all the data points.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> Think of Thin Plate Spline interpolation like placing a flexible sheet of metal
/// over a set of pins (your data points) at different heights. The metal bends to touch all pins
/// while maintaining the smoothest possible surface between them. This method is excellent for
/// creating smooth surfaces from scattered measurements, such as elevation data or temperature
/// readings taken at irregular locations.

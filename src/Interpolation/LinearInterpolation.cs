/// Linear interpolation is the simplest form of interpolation, connecting data points with straight lines.
/// It estimates values between known data points by assuming a straight line between them.
/// 
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> Linear interpolation is like drawing straight lines between dots on a graph.
/// If you have two points (like one at x=1, y=10 and another at x=3, y=20), and you want to know
/// what the y-value would be at x=2, linear interpolation would give you y=15 because it's exactly
/// halfway between the two known points. It's the simplest and most intuitive way to estimate values
/// between known points.

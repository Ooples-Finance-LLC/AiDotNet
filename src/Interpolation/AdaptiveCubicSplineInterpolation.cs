/// <summary>
/// Provides an adaptive cubic spline interpolation that automatically switches between natural and monotonic 
/// cubic splines based on data characteristics.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This class implements an intelligent interpolation strategy that combines the smoothness of natural 
/// cubic splines with the shape-preserving properties of monotonic cubic splines.
/// 
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> Interpolation is like "connecting the dots" between data points to create a smooth curve.
/// 
/// Imagine you have several points on a graph and want to draw a smooth line through them:
/// - Natural cubic splines create very smooth curves but might overshoot or create waves where your data doesn't have them
/// - Monotonic splines preserve the "shape" of your data (keeping increasing parts increasing, etc.) but might be less smooth
/// 
/// This adaptive method gives you the best of both worlds by:
/// 1. Looking at each segment of your data
/// 2. Deciding whether to use the smoother method or the shape-preserving method for that segment
/// 3. Automatically switching between methods as needed
/// 
/// It's like having a smart drawing assistant that chooses the right tool for each part of your curve!

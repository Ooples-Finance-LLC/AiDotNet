/// Implements Lagrange polynomial interpolation for one-dimensional data points.

/// <remarks>
/// Lagrange polynomial interpolation creates a smooth curve that passes exactly through 
/// all provided data points. It's particularly useful for estimating values between known points.
/// 
/// For Beginners: Think of this like connecting dots with a smooth curve. If you have several
/// points on a graph, Lagrange interpolation draws a smooth line through all of them, allowing
/// you to estimate values between your known points. Unlike simpler methods like linear interpolation
/// (which just draws straight lines between points), this creates a natural-looking curve.

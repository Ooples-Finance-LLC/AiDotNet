/// Implements Bilinear Interpolation for estimating values between points in a 2D grid.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Bilinear interpolation creates a smooth surface that passes through a grid of known data points.
/// It's commonly used for image resizing, terrain modeling, and data visualization.
/// 
/// For Beginners: Think of bilinear interpolation as a way to "fill in the blanks" between points in a grid.
/// Imagine you have a grid of temperature readings taken at different locations, but you want to know
/// the temperature at a location between your measurement points. Bilinear interpolation gives you
/// an estimated value based on the four nearest known points.
/// 
/// Unlike simply picking the closest point's value, bilinear interpolation creates a smooth blend
/// between all four surrounding points, giving a more natural and accurate estimate.
/// </remarks>

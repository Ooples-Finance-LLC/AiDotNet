/// <summary>
/// Implements Hermite interpolation for one-dimensional data points.

/// <remarks>
/// Hermite interpolation creates a smooth curve that passes through all given data points
/// while also matching specified derivatives (slopes) at those points. This provides more
/// control over the shape of the curve compared to simpler interpolation methods.
/// 
/// For Beginners: This class helps you estimate values between known data points when you
/// know not only the values at certain points but also how quickly those values are changing
/// (the slopes) at those points. Imagine drawing a smooth curve through dots on a graph,
/// but also controlling which direction the curve is heading as it passes through each dot.
/// This gives you a more natural-looking curve that respects both the values and their rates
/// of change.

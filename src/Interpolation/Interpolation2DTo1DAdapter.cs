/// <remarks>
/// This adapter allows you to use a 2D interpolation method as if it were a 1D interpolation
/// by keeping one of the coordinates (either X or Y) at a fixed value.
/// 
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> Think of this like taking a slice through a 3D surface. Imagine a landscape
/// with hills and valleys - if you cut through it in a straight line, you get a 2D profile
/// showing the heights along that line. This adapter does something similar - it takes a 2D
/// interpolation (which works with X and Y coordinates) and creates a 1D view of it (which
/// only needs one coordinate) by fixing either the X or Y value.

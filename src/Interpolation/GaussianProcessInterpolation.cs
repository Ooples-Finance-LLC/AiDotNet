/// Implements Gaussian Process interpolation for one-dimensional data points.

/// <remarks>
/// Gaussian Process interpolation is a probabilistic approach to interpolation that not only
/// provides estimates for unknown points but also quantifies the uncertainty in those estimates.
/// 
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> This class helps you estimate values between known data points using a technique
/// that's especially good when your data might contain noise or uncertainty. Think of it like
/// drawing a smooth line through your points, but also showing a "confidence band" around that
/// line to indicate how certain the estimates are. It's particularly useful when you have limited
/// data or when you want to know how reliable your estimates are.

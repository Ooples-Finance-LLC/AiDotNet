/// <b>For Beginners:</b> This class helps you estimate values between known data points.
/// Imagine you have measurements at specific times (like temperature readings every hour),
/// and you want to estimate what happened between those measurements. Cubic spline
/// interpolation creates a smooth curve that passes through all your known points and
/// provides natural-looking estimates for the points in between. It's like connecting
/// dots with a flexible curve rather than straight lines.

/// Implements Kochanek-Bartels spline interpolation for one-dimensional data points.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Kochanek-Bartels splines (also known as TCB splines) provide control over the shape of the curve
/// through three parameters: tension, continuity, and bias. This allows for more flexible and
/// customizable interpolation compared to simpler methods.
/// 
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> This interpolation method creates smooth curves between data points with
/// special controls that let you adjust how the curve looks. Imagine drawing a line through
/// dots on a graph, but being able to control how "tight" the curve is, how smoothly it
/// transitions between segments, and whether it tends to overshoot or undershoot. This is
/// particularly useful for animation paths or when you need precise control over the shape
/// of a curve.

    ///   - Negative values (-1 to 0): Makes the curve looser, with more overshoot
    ///   - Zero: Natural curve, balanced between tight and loose

    ///   - Negative values (-1 to 0): Curve leans toward the next point
    ///   - Zero: Balanced curve, doesn't favor either direction

    ///   - Positive values (0 to 1): Creates sharper corners at data points

/// <remarks>
/// Lanczos interpolation is a high-quality resampling technique that uses a windowed sinc function
/// to create smooth interpolations between data points. It's commonly used in image and signal processing.
/// 
/// For Beginners: Lanczos interpolation is like a sophisticated way of estimating values between known points.
/// Imagine you have several dots on a graph and want to draw a smooth curve through them. Lanczos uses a special
/// mathematical approach that creates a natural-looking curve while preserving important details in your data.
/// It's particularly good at maintaining sharp edges while still creating smooth transitions, which is why
/// it's popular for resizing images and processing signals.

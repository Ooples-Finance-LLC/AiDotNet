/// Implements Bicubic Interpolation for estimating values between points in a 2D grid.

/// <remarks>
/// Bicubic interpolation creates a smooth surface that passes through a grid of known data points.
/// It's commonly used for image resizing, terrain modeling, and scientific data visualization.
/// 
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> Think of this as a sophisticated way to "fill in the blanks" between points in a grid.
/// Imagine you have a grid of height measurements for a landscape (like a topographic map) but you want
/// to know the height at points between your measurements. Bicubic interpolation creates a smooth surface
/// that passes through all your known points and gives reasonable estimates for the in-between areas.
/// 
/// Unlike simpler methods, bicubic interpolation considers not just the nearest points but also how the
/// surface is changing (its "slope" and "curvature"), resulting in smoother, more natural-looking results.

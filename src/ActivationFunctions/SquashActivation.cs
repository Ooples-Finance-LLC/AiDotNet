/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The Squash activation function maps input vectors to have a magnitude (length) between 0 and 1 while
/// preserving their direction. This is particularly useful in capsule networks and other neural network
/// architectures where vector orientation is important.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// For Beginners: The Squash function is different from most activation functions because it works on
/// entire vectors (groups of numbers) rather than individual numbers. Think of a vector as an arrow
/// pointing in some direction with a certain length.
/// 
/// What Squash does:
/// 1. It keeps the arrow pointing in the same direction
/// 2. It adjusts the length of the arrow to be between 0 and 1
/// 3. Short vectors remain almost the same length
/// 4. Long vectors get "squashed" to be closer to length 1
/// 
/// This is useful in advanced neural networks like capsule networks, where the direction of a vector
/// represents important features, and the length represents the probability that those features exist.

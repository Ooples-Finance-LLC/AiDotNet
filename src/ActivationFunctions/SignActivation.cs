/// negative (-1), zero (0), or positive (1). It's one of the simplest activation functions and is useful when 
/// you want your neural network to make clear-cut decisions rather than produce probabilities or continuous values.
/// However, because it has sharp "jumps" in its output and its derivative is zero almost everywhere, it's rarely 
/// used in modern neural networks that rely on gradient-based learning.

/// For Beginners: The Gumbel-Softmax is a special activation function that helps neural networks
/// make categorical (multiple-choice) decisions while still allowing for gradient-based learning.
/// 
/// Imagine you want your neural network to choose between several options (like choosing a word
/// from a vocabulary). Normally, this would require a non-differentiable "hard" selection, which
/// makes training difficult. Gumbel-Softmax solves this by:
/// 
/// 1. Adding randomness (Gumbel noise) to the inputs
/// 2. Using a "temperature" parameter to control how "certain" the choices are
/// 3. Producing a probability distribution that can approximate discrete choices
/// 
/// At high temperatures, the output is very "soft" (all options get some probability).
/// At low temperatures, the output becomes more like a one-hot vector (one option gets almost all probability).
/// 
/// This technique is widely used in generative models, reinforcement learning, and any neural network
/// that needs to make discrete choices while remaining differentiable.

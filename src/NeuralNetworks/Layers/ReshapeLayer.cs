/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This layer changes how your data is organized without changing the data itself.

/// Think of the ReshapeLayer like reorganizing a deck of playing cards:
/// - If you have cards arranged in 4 rows of 13 cards (representing the 4 suits)
/// - You could reorganize them into 13 rows of 4 cards (representing the 13 ranks)
/// - The cards themselves haven't changed, just how they're arranged
/// 
/// For example, in image processing:
/// - You might have an image of shape [height, width, channels]
/// - But a particular layer might need the data as a flat vector
/// - A reshape layer can convert between these formats without losing information
/// 
/// Common use cases include:
/// - Flattening data (e.g., converting a 2D image to a 1D vector for a dense layer)
/// - Reshaping for convolutional operations (e.g., turning a vector into a 3D tensor)
/// - Batch dimension manipulation (e.g., splitting or combining batch items)

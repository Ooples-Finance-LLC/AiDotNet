/// <para>
/// A temporal memory layer implements a simplified version of Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) concepts to learn
/// sequential patterns in data. It organizes cells into columns, where cells within the same column represent
/// alternative contexts for the same input pattern. This allows the layer to maintain multiple predictions
/// simultaneously and learn temporal patterns in the input data.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This layer helps the network remember and predict sequences of patterns.
/// 
/// Think of it like learning to anticipate what comes next in a song:
/// - The layer organizes memory cells into columns (like musical notes)
/// - Each column can have multiple cells (representing different contexts for the same note)
/// - When a note plays, the layer activates specific cells based on what came before
/// - Over time, it learns which notes typically follow others in different contexts
/// 
/// For example, in a melody, the note "C" might be followed by "D" in the verse but by "G" in the chorus.
/// This layer helps the network learn such context-dependent sequences by remembering not just what
/// happened, but the context in which it happened.

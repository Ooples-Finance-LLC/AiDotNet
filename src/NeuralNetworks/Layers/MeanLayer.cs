/// Think of it like calculating the average test score for each student across multiple subjects:
/// - Input: A table of scores where rows are students and columns are subjects
/// - MeanLayer with axis=1 (columns): Gives each student's average score across all subjects

/// Some practical examples:
/// - In image processing: Taking the average across color channels
/// - In text analysis: Taking the average of word embeddings to get a sentence representation
/// - In time series: Taking the average across time steps to get a summary

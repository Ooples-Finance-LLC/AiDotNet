/// A concatenate layer combines multiple input tensors into a single output tensor by joining them along
/// a specified axis. For example, if you have two tensors of shape [batch_size, 10] and [batch_size, 15],
/// concatenating them along axis 1 would produce a tensor of shape [batch_size, 25]. This layer doesn't
/// have any trainable parameters and simply passes the gradients back to the appropriate input tensors
/// during backpropagation.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A concatenate layer joins multiple inputs together to make one bigger output.
/// 
/// Think of it like joining arrays or lists:
/// - If you have two lists [1, 2, 3] and [4, 5], concatenating them gives [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
/// 
/// In neural networks, we often work with multi-dimensional data, so we need to specify which
/// dimension (axis) to join along:
/// 
/// - Axis 0 would join along the first dimension (like stacking sheets of paper)
/// - Axis 1 would join along the second dimension (like extending rows sideways)
/// - Axis 2 would join along the third dimension (like extending columns downward)
/// 
/// For example, if you have:
/// - One tensor representing features from an image: [batch_size, 100]
/// - Another tensor representing features from text: [batch_size, 50]
/// 
/// You could use a concatenate layer with axis=1 to create a combined feature tensor of shape [batch_size, 150]
/// that contains both sets of features side by side.

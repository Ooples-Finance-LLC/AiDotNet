/// Gaussian noise layers help prevent overfitting by adding random noise to the input data.
/// This forces the network to learn more robust features that can withstand small variations.
/// The noise follows a Gaussian (normal) distribution with a specified mean and standard deviation.

/// Think of it like training an athlete in challenging conditions:
/// - Training in rain and wind makes athletes perform better even in good weather
/// - Training with noise makes neural networks perform better on clean data

/// For example, in image recognition:
/// - During training: The layer slightly changes pixel values randomly
/// - This forces the network to focus on important patterns, not tiny details
/// - During testing/prediction: No noise is added, giving clean results

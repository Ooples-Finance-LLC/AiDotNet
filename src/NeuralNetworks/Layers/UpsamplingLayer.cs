/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// An upsampling layer increases the spatial dimensions (height and width) of input tensors by repeating values from
/// the input to create a larger output. This implementation uses nearest-neighbor interpolation, which repeats each
/// value in the input tensor multiple times based on the scale factor to create the upsampled output.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This layer makes images or feature maps larger by simply repeating pixels.
/// 
/// Think of it like zooming in on a digital image:
/// - When you zoom in on a pixelated image, each original pixel becomes a larger square
/// - This layer does the same thing to feature maps inside the neural network
/// - It's like stretching an image without adding any new information
/// 
/// For example, with a scale factor of 2:
/// - A 4×4 image becomes an 8×8 image
/// - Each pixel in the original image is copied to a 2×2 block in the output
/// - This creates a larger image that preserves the original content but with more pixels
/// 
/// This is useful for tasks like image generation or upscaling, where you need to increase
/// the resolution of features that the network has processed.

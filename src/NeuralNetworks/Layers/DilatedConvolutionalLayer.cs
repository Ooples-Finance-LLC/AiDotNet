/// <para>
/// A dilated convolutional layer extends traditional convolutional layers by introducing gaps (dilation) between 
/// the elements of the convolution kernel. This increases the receptive field without increasing the number of 
/// parameters or computational cost. Dilated convolutions are particularly useful in tasks requiring a wide 
/// context without sacrificing resolution, such as semantic segmentation or audio generation.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A dilated convolutional layer is like looking at an image with a special magnifying glass.
/// 
/// Regular convolutions look at pixels that are right next to each other, like this:
/// - Looking at a 3×3 area of an image (9 adjacent pixels)
/// 
/// Dilated convolutions skip some pixels, creating gaps, like this:
/// - With dilation=2, it looks at pixels with a gap of 1 pixel between them
/// - The 3×3 filter now covers a 5×5 area (still using only 9 values)
/// 
/// Benefits:
/// - Sees a larger area without needing more computing power
/// - Captures wider patterns in the data
/// - Helps detect features at different scales
/// 
/// For example, in image processing, dilated convolutions can help the network understand 
/// both fine details and broader context at the same time.

/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The Locally Connected layer is similar to a convolutional layer in that it applies filters to local regions 
/// of the input, but differs in that it uses different filter weights for each spatial location. This increases
/// the number of parameters and the expressiveness of the model, but reduces generalization capabilities.
/// It's useful when the patterns in different regions of the input are inherently different, such as in
/// face recognition where different parts of a face have different characteristics.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This layer is like a specialized convolutional layer where each region gets its own unique filter.
/// 
/// Think of a Locally Connected layer like having specialized detectors for different regions:
/// - In a regular convolutional layer, the same filter slides across the entire input
/// - In a locally connected layer, each position has its own unique filter
/// - This means the layer can learn location-specific features
/// 
/// For example, in face recognition:
/// - A convolutional layer would use the same detector for eyes, whether looking at the top-left or bottom-right
/// - A locally connected layer would use different detectors depending on where it's looking
/// 
/// This specialization increases the model's power but:
/// - Requires more parameters
/// - May not generalize as well to new examples
/// - Is more computationally intensive

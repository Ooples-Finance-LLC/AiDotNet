/// into capsule vectors. It performs a convolution operation followed by reshaping the output into capsules.
/// Each capsule represents a group of neurons that encodes both the presence and properties of a particular entity.

/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This layer is the first step in creating a capsule network.

/// In traditional neural networks, each neuron outputs a single number indicating the presence of a feature.
/// In capsule networks, neurons are grouped into "capsules" where each capsule outputs a vector:
/// - The length of the vector represents the presence of an entity
/// - The orientation of the vector represents properties of that entity
/// 
/// Think of it like this:
/// - Standard neurons: "I see a nose with 90% confidence"
/// - Capsule neurons: "I see a nose with 90% confidence, and it's pointing 30° to the left, 
///   it's 2cm long, it has a slightly curved shape..."
/// 
/// The primary capsule layer converts traditional feature maps (from convolutional layers)
/// into these vector-based capsules that can capture more detailed information about the entities detected.

/// This approach helps the network understand spatial relationships and maintain information
/// about pose, orientation, and other properties that are typically lost in traditional networks.

/// <para>
/// A bidirectional layer processes input sequences in two directions: forward (from first to last) and backward 
/// (from last to first). This approach allows the layer to capture patterns that depend on both past and future 
/// context. The outputs from both directions can either be merged (typically added together) or kept separate, 
/// depending on the configuration.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This layer looks at input data in two ways at the same time - both forward and backward.
/// 
/// Think of it like reading a sentence:
/// - Forward reading: "The cat sat on the mat" (left to right)
/// - Backward reading: "mat the on sat cat The" (right to left)
/// 
/// By processing data in both directions:
/// - The layer can understand context from both past and future elements
/// - It can discover patterns that might be missed if only looking in one direction
/// - It often improves performance on sequence tasks like text processing
/// 
/// For example, in the sentence "The bank is by the river", the meaning of "bank" 
/// depends on both previous words ("The") and future words ("by the river").
/// A bidirectional layer helps capture these relationships.

/// The Lambda Layer allows for custom transformations to be incorporated into a neural network by accepting
/// user-defined functions for both the forward and backward passes. This provides flexibility to implement
/// custom operations that aren't available as standard layers. The layer can optionally apply an activation
/// function after the custom transformation.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This layer lets you create your own custom operations in a neural network.

/// Think of the Lambda Layer as a "do-it-yourself" layer where:
/// - You provide your own custom function to process the data
/// - You can optionally provide a custom function for the learning process
/// - It gives you flexibility to implement operations not covered by standard layers
/// 
/// For example, if you wanted to apply a special mathematical transformation that isn't
/// available in standard layers, you could define that transformation and use it in a Lambda Layer.
/// 
/// This is an advanced feature that gives you complete control when standard layers
/// don't provide what you need.

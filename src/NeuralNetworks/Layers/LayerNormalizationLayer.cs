/// Represents a Layer Normalization layer that normalizes inputs across the feature dimension.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Layer Normalization is a technique used to normalize the inputs to a layer, which can help improve
/// training stability and speed. Unlike Batch Normalization which normalizes across the batch dimension,
/// Layer Normalization normalizes across the feature dimension independently for each sample. This makes
/// it particularly useful for recurrent networks and when batch sizes are small. The layer learns scale
/// (gamma) and shift (beta) parameters to allow the network to recover the original representation if needed.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This layer helps stabilize and speed up training by standardizing the data.
/// 
/// Think of Layer Normalization like standardizing test scores:
/// - It makes each sample's features have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1
/// - It does this independently for each sample (unlike Batch Normalization)
/// - It applies this normalization along the feature dimension
/// - After normalizing, it scales and shifts the values using learnable parameters
/// 
/// For example, in a sentiment analysis task, some input sentences might use very positive words while 
/// others use more neutral language. Layer Normalization helps the network focus on the relative importance 
/// of features within each sample rather than their absolute values.
/// 
/// This is particularly useful for:
/// - Recurrent neural networks
/// - Cases where batch sizes are small
/// - Making training more stable and faster

/// <para>
/// A feed-forward layer, also known as a fully connected or dense layer, is one of the most common
/// types of neural network layers. It connects every input neuron to every output neuron with
/// learnable weights. Each output neuron also has a learnable bias term. The layer applies a linear
/// transformation followed by an activation function to produce its output.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A feed-forward layer is like a voting system where every input gets to vote on every output.
/// 
/// Imagine you have 3 inputs and 2 outputs:
/// - Each input has a different level of influence (weight) on each output
/// - Each output has its own starting value (bias)
/// - The layer calculates each output by combining all input influences plus the bias
/// - Finally, an activation function adds non-linearity (like setting a threshold)
/// 
/// For example:
/// - Input: [0.2, 0.5, 0.1] (representing features from previous layer)
/// - Weights: [[0.1, 0.8], [0.4, 0.3], [0.7, 0.2]] (each input's influence on each output)
/// - Biases: [0.1, -0.2] (starting values for each output)
/// - Output before activation: [0.2×0.1 + 0.5×0.4 + 0.1×0.7 + 0.1, 0.2×0.8 + 0.5×0.3 + 0.1×0.2 - 0.2]
///                           = [0.39, 0.33]
/// - After activation (e.g., ReLU): [0.39, 0.33] (since both are already positive)
/// 
/// Feed-forward layers are the building blocks of many neural networks. Multiple
/// feed-forward layers stacked together form a "deep" neural network that can
/// learn increasingly complex patterns.

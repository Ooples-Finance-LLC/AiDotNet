/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// A transformer encoder layer is a fundamental building block of transformer-based models for sequence processing tasks.
/// It consists of two main components: a self-attention mechanism that allows each position in a sequence to attend to all
/// positions, and a feed-forward network that processes each position independently. Each component is followed by layer
/// normalization and residual connections to facilitate training of deep networks.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This layer helps a neural network understand relationships between different elements in a sequence.
/// 
/// Think of it like a careful reader analyzing a paragraph:
/// - First, the reader looks at how each word relates to every other word (self-attention)
/// - Then, the reader processes this information to understand the meaning (feed-forward network)
/// 
/// For example, in the sentence "The animal didn't cross the street because it was too wide":
/// - The self-attention helps the network understand that "it" refers to "the street" (not "the animal")
/// - The feed-forward network processes this contextual information for each word
/// 
/// This architecture is powerful for tasks like understanding text, analyzing time series, or processing any data
/// where the relationships between elements matter.

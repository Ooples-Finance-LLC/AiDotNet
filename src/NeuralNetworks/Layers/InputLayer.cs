/// <para>
/// The Input Layer serves as the entry point for data into a neural network. Unlike other layers, 
/// it doesn't transform the data or learn any parameters; it simply validates and passes the input
/// through to the next layer. This layer establishes the dimensionality of the input data for the
/// entire network.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This layer is like the doorway to your neural network.
/// 
/// Think of the InputLayer as:
/// - The entrance where your data first enters the neural network
/// - A way to tell the network what shape your data has
/// - A pass-through that doesn't change your data
/// 
/// For example, if you're processing images that are 28x28 pixels, you would use an InputLayer
/// with inputSize=784 (28×28) to tell the network about the size of each image.
/// 
/// Unlike other layers, the InputLayer doesn't learn or transform anything - it just
/// passes your data into the network.

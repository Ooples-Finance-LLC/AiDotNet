/// NSGA-II is an advanced genetic algorithm designed for problems with multiple competing objectives.
/// It extends the standard genetic algorithm by incorporating Pareto-based ranking and crowding distance
/// to maintain diversity in the population while optimizing for multiple objectives simultaneously.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Think of NSGA-II like a home-buying agent that helps you find the best house.
/// 
/// In regular optimization, you might just look for the cheapest house. But in real life, you care about:
/// - Price (lower is better)
/// - Location (closer to work is better)
/// - Size (larger is better)
/// - Quality (higher is better)
/// 
/// These goals conflict - a bigger house usually costs more, a better location often means smaller size, etc.
/// 
/// NSGA-II is like a smart agent that:
/// 1. Finds a variety of houses representing different trade-offs (the "Pareto front")
/// 2. Organizes houses into tiers based on how good the trade-offs are
/// 3. Makes sure you have diverse options within each tier (not just 10 similar houses)
/// 4. Gradually improves the selection over time by combining features from promising houses
/// 
/// Instead of one "best" solution, it provides a range of optimal trade-offs for you to choose from.

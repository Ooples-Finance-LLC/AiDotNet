/// <summary>
/// Implements a no-op regularization class that applies no regularization penalty to the model.

/// <typeparam name="T">The numeric type used for calculations (e.g., float, double).</typeparam>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// NoRegularization serves as a baseline implementation that passes through all values unchanged.
/// This class is useful when a regularization object is required by the architecture but you
/// don't want to apply any actual regularization to your model.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This class essentially turns off regularization.
/// 
/// Think of regularization as optional guardrails that keep your model from becoming too complex:
/// - L1 and L2 regularization add these guardrails
/// - NoRegularization removes all guardrails
/// - Your model is free to find the exact fit to your training data
/// 
/// For example:
/// - When using NoRegularization, your model can assign very large coefficients to features
/// - Nothing prevents the model from perfectly memorizing your training data
/// - This can be good for very simple problems or when you have a lot of data relative to features
/// 
/// You might use NoRegularization when:
/// - You're confident your model won't overfit
/// - You want to see how your model performs without regularization
/// - You're using other techniques to prevent overfitting (like early stopping)
/// </para>

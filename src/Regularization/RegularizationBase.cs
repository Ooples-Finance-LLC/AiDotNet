/// RegularizationBase serves as an abstract foundation for implementing various regularization strategies.
/// Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function
/// that discourages complex models. This base class defines the common interface and provides shared
/// functionality for all regularization implementations.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Think of regularization as adding "guardrails" to your model's learning process.
/// 
/// Imagine training a model is like teaching a student:
/// - Without regularization, the student might memorize all the test answers without understanding the principles
/// - With regularization, we encourage the student to learn simpler, more general rules
/// 
/// This base class provides the framework that all specific regularization techniques build upon.
/// Different regularization approaches (like L1, L2, or Elastic Net) are like different teaching
/// strategies, but they all aim to help your model generalize better to new data.
/// 
/// For example:
/// - L1 regularization eliminates less important features
/// - L2 regularization makes all features less extreme
/// - Elastic Net combines both approaches
/// 
/// All of these approaches inherit from this base class, which provides the common structure they all share.

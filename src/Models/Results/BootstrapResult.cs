    /// Bootstrap validation is a resampling technique used to evaluate machine learning models by repeatedly 
    /// sampling from the available data with replacement. This class stores the R² (coefficient of determination) 
    /// values for different data splits in the bootstrap process. R² measures the proportion of variance in the 
    /// dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables, with values ranging from 0 to 1 
    /// where higher values indicate better model fit. The class uses generic type parameter T to support different 
    /// numeric types for the R² values, such as float, double, or decimal.

    /// When evaluating machine learning models:
    /// - It's important to know how well they perform on different datasets
    /// - Bootstrap validation creates multiple samples from your data to test model stability
    /// - R² (R-squared) is a common metric that measures how well your model explains the variation in the data
    /// 
    /// This class stores three R² values:
    /// - Training R²: How well the model fits the data it was trained on
    /// - Validation R²: How well the model performs on data used for tuning
    /// - Test R²: How well the model generalizes to completely new data
    /// 
    /// These values help you understand:
    /// - If your model is underfitting (low R² on all datasets)
    /// - If your model is overfitting (high training R², much lower test R²)
    /// - How stable your model's performance is across different data splits

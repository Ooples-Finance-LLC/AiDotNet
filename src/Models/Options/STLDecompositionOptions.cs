/// STL (Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess) is a robust method for decomposing time series data into 
/// three components: seasonal, trend, and remainder (residual). It uses iterative Loess smoothing (locally 
/// estimated scatterplot smoothing) to extract these components, making it flexible for handling a wide 
/// variety of seasonal patterns and trends. The algorithm is particularly valuable for time series with 
/// complex seasonality, non-linear trends, or outliers. This class provides extensive configuration options 
/// for controlling the STL decomposition process, including parameters for the seasonal and trend components, 
/// robustness iterations, window sizes, and additional adjustments for calendar effects. These options allow 
/// fine-tuning of the decomposition to match the specific characteristics of the time series being analyzed.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> STL decomposition helps break down your time series into meaningful components.
/// 
/// When analyzing time series data:
/// - It's often useful to separate different patterns in the data
/// - STL decomposition splits your data into three parts:
///   1. Seasonal component: Repeating patterns (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)
///   2. Trend component: Long-term direction (increasing, decreasing, etc.)
///   3. Residual component: What remains after removing season and trend
/// 
/// This separation helps you:
/// - Understand the underlying patterns in your data
/// - Identify anomalies that don't fit the patterns
/// - Make better forecasts by modeling each component separately
/// - Remove seasonality to focus on the trend
/// 
/// STL uses a technique called LOESS (locally estimated scatterplot smoothing) to
/// extract these components in a flexible way that works for many different types of data.
/// 
/// This class lets you configure exactly how the decomposition works to best match your data.

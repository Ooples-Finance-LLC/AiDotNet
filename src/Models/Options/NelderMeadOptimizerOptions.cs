/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The Nelder-Mead method (also known as the downhill simplex method or amoeba method) is a numerical
/// optimization technique that does not require derivative information. It works by constructing a simplex
/// (a generalization of a triangle to higher dimensions) and systematically replacing the worst vertex
/// of this simplex with a new point through a series of reflection, expansion, contraction, and shrinking
/// operations. This approach is particularly useful for problems where the objective function is non-differentiable,
/// is not known in closed form, or when gradient calculations are computationally expensive or unstable.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> The Nelder-Mead algorithm is a clever way to find the minimum value of a function
/// without needing to calculate derivatives (which can be complicated or impossible for some problems).
/// 
/// Imagine you're trying to find the lowest point in a hilly landscape:
/// - Instead of following the steepest downhill path (as gradient-based methods do)
/// - Nelder-Mead places a "flexible shape" on the landscape (like a triangle in 2D space)
/// - It then moves and reshapes this triangle, always trying to "slide" toward lower ground
/// 
/// The algorithm works through a series of simple operations:
/// - Reflection: Try moving away from the highest point
/// - Expansion: If that works well, try moving even further
/// - Contraction: If reflection doesn't work, try moving a shorter distance
/// - Shrinking: If all else fails, make the triangle smaller and try again
/// 
/// This class allows you to configure how aggressively or cautiously these operations are performed,
/// which affects how quickly and reliably the algorithm can find the optimal solution.

/// <para>
/// Mini-Batch Gradient Descent is a variation of the gradient descent optimization algorithm that strikes a
/// balance between the efficiency of stochastic gradient descent and the stability of batch gradient descent.
/// It updates model parameters after processing small randomly-selected subsets (mini-batches) of the training
/// data, rather than processing individual samples (as in stochastic gradient descent) or the entire dataset
/// (as in batch gradient descent). This approach often converges faster than batch methods while providing
/// more stable updates than purely stochastic methods.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Mini-Batch Gradient Descent is a method for training machine learning models
/// that tries to find the best values for the model's internal settings (parameters).
/// 
/// Imagine you're trying to find the lowest point in a hilly landscape while blindfolded:
/// - Full Batch Gradient Descent: You survey the entire landscape before taking each step
/// - Stochastic Gradient Descent: You take a step based on checking just one random spot
/// - Mini-Batch Gradient Descent: You check a small random sample of spots before each step
/// 
/// This middle-ground approach is popular because:
/// - It's faster than checking the entire landscape each time
/// - It's more stable than making decisions based on just one spot
/// - It works well with modern hardware that can efficiently process small batches
/// 
/// This class allows you to configure how this learning process works: how many examples to look at
/// in each batch, how long to train, and how the algorithm adjusts its step size over time.

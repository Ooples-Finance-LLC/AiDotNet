/// <para>
/// ARMA is a statistical model used for analyzing and forecasting time series data. It combines two components:
/// AutoRegressive (AR) and Moving Average (MA) to model stationary time series data.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> ARMA is a method for predicting future values in a time series (data collected 
/// over time, like daily stock prices or monthly sales figures). It works by combining two techniques: 
/// looking at how past values influence future ones (AutoRegressive) and accounting for the impact of past 
/// prediction errors (Moving Average). Think of it like predicting tomorrow's weather by considering both 
/// today's weather (AR component) and how accurate previous forecasts have been (MA component). Unlike ARIMA, 
/// ARMA assumes your data doesn't have strong upward or downward trends that need to be removed first.</para>

/// Residual analysis is a critical technique in regression modeling that examines the differences between 
/// observed values and predicted values (residuals) to assess model fit quality. This class provides 
/// configuration options for threshold values used to determine whether a model's residuals indicate 
/// a good fit. The detector evaluates several statistical measures including the mean of residuals, 
/// standard deviation of residuals, Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and the coefficient of 
/// determination (R²). By adjusting these thresholds, users can control how strictly the detector 
/// evaluates model fit according to their specific requirements and domain knowledge.

/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This class helps you decide if your prediction model is doing a good job.

/// When a model makes predictions, it's rarely perfect. The differences between what your model 
/// predicted and the actual values are called "residuals." Analyzing these residuals helps determine 
/// if your model is working well.
/// 
/// Think of it like this:
/// - You have a weather app that predicts temperatures
/// - Some days it predicts 75°F when the actual temperature is 73°F (residual of -2°F)
/// - Other days it predicts 68°F when the actual temperature is 72°F (residual of +4°F)
/// - By analyzing all these differences, you can tell if your model is reliable
/// 
/// This class lets you set thresholds for different statistical measures:
/// - How close the average residual should be to zero
/// - How consistent the residuals should be (not too scattered)
/// - How small the percentage errors should be
/// - How much of the data variation your model explains
/// 
/// If your model's residuals stay within these thresholds, it passes the "fit test" and is 
/// considered reliable for making predictions.

/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Nadam (Nesterov-accelerated Adaptive Moment Estimation) is an optimization algorithm that extends
/// Adam by incorporating Nesterov momentum. Like Adam, it maintains adaptive learning rates for each
/// parameter based on estimates of first and second moments of the gradients. Additionally, it applies
/// the Nesterov acceleration technique, which evaluates the gradient at a "look-ahead" position rather
/// than the current position. This combination often leads to faster convergence than standard Adam,
/// particularly for problems with complex loss landscapes or sparse gradients.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Nadam is an advanced optimization algorithm that helps neural networks
/// and other machine learning models learn more efficiently.
/// 
/// Imagine you're trying to navigate to the lowest point in a hilly landscape while blindfolded:
/// - Standard gradient descent is like taking steps directly downhill from where you're standing
/// - Adam adds adaptive step sizes (taking bigger steps in flat areas, smaller steps in steep areas)
/// - Nadam goes a step further by trying to predict where you'll be after your next step and looking
///   at the downhill direction from that predicted position
/// 
/// This combination of techniques helps the algorithm:
/// - Learn faster than simpler methods
/// - Avoid getting stuck in small dips that aren't the true lowest point
/// - Adapt to different parts of the learning process with appropriate step sizes
/// 
/// This class lets you fine-tune how Nadam works: how quickly it learns, how much it relies on past
/// information, and how it adapts its learning rate during training.

/// <summary>
/// Represents the configuration options for cross-validation in machine learning models.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// This class encapsulates various settings that control how cross-validation is performed. It allows users to customize 
/// the validation process, including the number of folds, type of validation, data shuffling, and which metrics to compute.
/// These options provide flexibility in how models are evaluated, enabling users to tailor the validation process to their 
/// specific needs and dataset characteristics.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This class is like a settings panel for cross-validation.
/// 
/// What it does:
/// - Lets you choose how many parts (folds) to split your data into
/// - Allows you to pick the type of cross-validation you want to use
/// - Gives you the option to shuffle your data randomly
/// - Lets you decide which measurements (metrics) to use when evaluating your model
/// 
/// It's like customizing the rules for a series of tests your model will go through, ensuring you get the most useful 
/// information about how well your model performs.

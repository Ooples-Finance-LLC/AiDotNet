/// Time series regression extends traditional regression analysis to account for the temporal nature of data,
/// where observations are collected sequentially over time. These models can capture trends, seasonal patterns,
/// and the effects of past values on current and future values.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Time series regression helps you analyze and predict data that changes over time,
/// like stock prices, weather patterns, or monthly sales figures. Unlike regular regression that just looks for
/// relationships between variables, time series regression also considers when things happened. It can detect
/// patterns like "sales always increase in December" or "temperature today is related to temperature yesterday."
/// This class lets you configure how the model analyzes these time-based patterns.</para>

/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Shapley values, derived from cooperative game theory, provide a method for fairly distributing the 
/// "contribution" of each feature to the prediction made by a machine learning model. The Shapley Value 
/// Fit Detector uses these values to assess model fit by analyzing the distribution of feature importance. 
/// It identifies which features contribute significantly to the model's predictions and uses this information 
/// to detect potential overfitting (when the model relies too heavily on too few features) or underfitting 
/// (when the model distributes importance too evenly across many features). This class provides configuration 
/// options for the thresholds used in this analysis, including the cumulative importance threshold for 
/// identifying significant features, the number of Monte Carlo samples for calculating Shapley values, 
/// and thresholds for detecting overfitting and underfitting based on the ratio of important features.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This class helps evaluate if your model is using features appropriately.
/// 
/// Shapley values measure how much each feature contributes to your model's predictions:
/// - They come from game theory and provide a fair way to distribute "credit" among features
/// - They show which features are doing the heavy lifting in your model
/// - They can reveal if your model is using features in a balanced way
/// 
/// The detector uses these values to identify potential problems:
/// - Overfitting: When your model relies too heavily on just a few features (like memorizing the data)
/// - Underfitting: When your model spreads importance too evenly across many features (not finding strong patterns)
/// 
/// For example, in a house price prediction model:
/// - Overfitting might show up as the model relying almost entirely on exact address
/// - Underfitting might show up as the model giving similar importance to crucial factors (like location)
///   and irrelevant ones (like the day of week the house was listed)
/// 
/// This class lets you configure how the detector evaluates feature importance distribution
/// to identify these potential issues.

    /// - Often a small subset of features contributes most of the predictive power
    /// - This threshold helps identify that critical subset

    /// - Increase it (e.g., to 0.9) to include more features in your "important" set

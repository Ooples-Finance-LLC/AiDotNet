/// Spectral analysis is a technique used to decompose a time series signal into its constituent frequency 
/// components, revealing periodic patterns that might not be apparent in the original time domain representation. 
/// This is typically accomplished using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, which efficiently computes 
/// the Discrete Fourier Transform of a signal. The resulting frequency spectrum shows the amplitude and phase 
/// of different frequency components present in the signal. This class provides configuration options for 
/// spectral analysis, including the FFT size, window function selection, and overlap settings for spectrograms 
/// or short-time Fourier transforms. These options allow fine-tuning of the spectral analysis to balance 
/// frequency resolution, time resolution, and spectral leakage based on the specific characteristics of the 
/// time series being analyzed.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Spectral analysis helps identify repeating patterns in your time series data.
/// 
/// Time series data shows how values change over time, but sometimes it's hard to see patterns:
/// - A stock price might fluctuate in ways that look random
/// - Sensor readings might contain multiple overlapping cycles
/// - Audio signals contain many frequencies mixed together
/// 
/// Spectral analysis transforms this data from the time domain to the frequency domain:
/// - Instead of seeing "what happened when"
/// - You see "which cycles/frequencies are present and how strong they are"
/// 
/// This is like:
/// - Breaking down a musical chord into individual notes
/// - Identifying that a stock has both weekly and quarterly patterns
/// - Finding that a machine vibrates at specific frequencies when it's about to fail
/// 
/// This class lets you configure how this transformation happens, controlling the
/// trade-offs between frequency precision, time precision, and other factors.

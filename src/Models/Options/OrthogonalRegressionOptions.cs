/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Orthogonal Regression differs from standard regression techniques by considering measurement errors 
/// in both the predictor (independent) and response (dependent) variables. While ordinary least squares 
/// regression minimizes vertical distances from points to the regression line, orthogonal regression 
/// minimizes perpendicular distances, making it more appropriate when both variables contain measurement 
/// error or uncertainty. This approach is particularly valuable in fields like physics, chemistry, and 
/// engineering where measurement instruments may introduce errors in all variables. The algorithm typically 
/// employs singular value decomposition or iterative methods to find the optimal solution.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Orthogonal Regression is a special type of regression that treats all variables fairly when finding patterns.
/// 
/// In standard regression:
/// - We assume that only the y-variable (what we're predicting) contains errors
/// - We minimize the vertical distances from points to the line
/// 
/// Imagine measuring the heights and weights of people:
/// - Standard regression assumes heights are measured perfectly, only weights have errors
/// - Orthogonal regression recognizes that both height AND weight measurements have errors
/// 
/// This matters because:
/// - When both variables have measurement errors, standard regression can give biased results
/// - Orthogonal regression fits a line that's "fair" to both variables
/// - The line minimizes the perpendicular distance from points to the line, not just vertical distance
/// 
/// This technique is especially useful in scientific applications where:
/// - All measurements come from instruments with known error rates
/// - We're looking for true physical relationships rather than just predictions
/// - The variables play symmetrical roles rather than strictly "input" and "output"
/// 
/// This class lets you configure how the orthogonal regression algorithm works, controlling
/// its precision, computational limits, and data preprocessing.

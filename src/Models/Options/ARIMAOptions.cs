/// <para>
/// ARIMA is a statistical model used for analyzing and forecasting time series data. It combines three components:
/// AutoRegressive (AR), Integrated (I), and Moving Average (MA) to model time series data that exhibits non-stationarity.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> ARIMA is a popular method for predicting future values in a time series (data collected 
/// over time, like daily temperatures or monthly sales). It works by combining three techniques: looking at how past values 
/// influence future ones (AutoRegressive), removing trends by taking differences between consecutive values (Integrated), 
/// and accounting for the impact of past prediction errors (Moving Average). Think of it like predicting tomorrow's weather 
/// by considering today's weather, the recent trend of warming or cooling, and how accurate previous forecasts have been.</para>

/// <para>
/// The Conjugate Gradient method is an advanced optimization algorithm that often converges faster than
/// standard gradient descent. It uses information from previous iterations to determine more efficient search directions,
/// making it particularly effective for problems with many parameters.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Think of training a machine learning model like finding the lowest point in a valley.
/// The Conjugate Gradient method is like a smart hiker who remembers previous paths they've taken and uses that
/// information to find shortcuts to the bottom. This is often faster than basic methods that only look at the
/// current slope. This class lets you control how this "smart hiker" behaves - how big steps they take, when they
/// decide they're close enough to the bottom, and how many attempts they'll make before giving up.</para>

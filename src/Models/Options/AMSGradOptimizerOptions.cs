/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// AMSGrad is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm that combines the benefits of AdaGrad and RMSProp
/// while ensuring convergence by using a non-decreasing learning rate adjustment. It's particularly effective for
/// deep learning models and non-convex optimization problems.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> AMSGrad is like a smart running coach that adjusts your training pace based on your
/// past performance. It remembers how difficult different parts of your training have been and adjusts accordingly,
/// making sure you don't slow down too much on challenging sections. This helps your AI model learn more efficiently
/// by giving more attention to important patterns and less to noise in the data. Unlike some other methods, AMSGrad
/// ensures that your learning progress never goes backward, which helps it reach better solutions.</para>

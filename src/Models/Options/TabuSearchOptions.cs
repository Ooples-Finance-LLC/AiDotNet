/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Tabu Search is an iterative neighborhood search algorithm that enhances local search by avoiding points 
/// in the search space that have already been visited. The main feature of Tabu Search is the use of explicit 
/// memory (the tabu list) with two goals: to prevent the search from revisiting previously visited solutions, 
/// and to explore unvisited areas of the solution space. This approach helps escape local optima and avoid 
/// cycling in the search process. Tabu Search is particularly effective for combinatorial optimization problems 
/// where the search space is discrete and contains many local optima. This class inherits from 
/// GeneticAlgorithmOptimizerOptions and adds parameters specific to Tabu Search, such as tabu list size, 
/// neighborhood size, and various adaptive parameters for controlling the search process.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Tabu Search is like exploring a maze while keeping a list of recently visited paths to avoid.
/// 
/// When solving optimization problems:
/// - Simple local search methods often get stuck in "local optima" (solutions that are better than their neighbors but not the best overall)
/// - They can also waste time revisiting the same solutions repeatedly
/// 
/// Tabu Search solves this by:
/// - Keeping a "tabu list" of recently visited solutions that are temporarily forbidden
/// - Forcing the search to explore new areas even if they initially seem worse
/// - Adaptively adjusting its parameters based on search progress
/// - Combining elements of memory, neighborhood exploration, and strategic oscillation
/// 
/// This approach offers several benefits:
/// - Effectively escapes local optima
/// - Avoids cycling through the same solutions
/// - Efficiently explores the solution space
/// - Works well for complex combinatorial problems
/// 
/// This class lets you configure how the Tabu Search algorithm behaves.

/// <para>
/// AdaDelta is an optimization algorithm that dynamically adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on historical gradient information.
/// It addresses some limitations of earlier algorithms by using a moving average of squared gradients.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> AdaDelta is like a smart learning system that automatically adjusts how quickly it learns based on past experience.
/// Instead of using a fixed learning speed, it slows down for parameters that change a lot and speeds up for those that change little.
/// This helps the model learn more efficiently without requiring manual tuning of the learning rate.

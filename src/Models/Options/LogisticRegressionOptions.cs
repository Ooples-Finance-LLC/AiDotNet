/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that predicts the probability of an
/// observation belonging to a certain class. Despite its name, it's used for classification rather
/// than regression. The algorithm applies the logistic function to a linear combination of features
/// to transform the output to a probability value between 0 and 1. The model parameters are typically
/// learned through an iterative optimization process like gradient descent, which aims to maximize
/// the likelihood of the observed data.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Logistic Regression is one of the most fundamental classification
/// algorithms in machine learning, used when you want to predict categories (like "yes/no" or "spam/not spam").
/// 
/// Despite having "regression" in its name, it's actually used for classification problems:
/// - It calculates the probability that something belongs to a particular category
/// - If the probability is above 50%, it predicts one category; otherwise, it predicts the other
/// 
/// Think of it like determining whether a student will pass or fail an exam:
/// - You gather information about study hours, attendance, and previous grades
/// - Logistic Regression learns how these factors contribute to passing probability
/// - When a new student comes along, you can predict their outcome based on these factors
/// 
/// This class allows you to configure how the algorithm learns these relationships from your data.

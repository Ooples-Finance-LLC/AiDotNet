/// Configuration options for the Learning Curve Fit Detector, which analyzes training progress

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The Learning Curve Fit Detector monitors the training progress of a machine learning model by
/// analyzing the pattern of error reduction over time. It fits a mathematical curve to the error
/// values and uses this to predict whether continued training is likely to yield significant
/// improvements. This can help automatically determine when to stop training.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> When training a machine learning model, it's important to know when
/// to stop. Training for too long can waste time or cause overfitting (where the model performs
/// well on training data but poorly on new data), while stopping too early might leave the model
/// under-trained.
/// 
/// The Learning Curve Fit Detector is like a smart assistant that watches how your model's performance
/// improves during training. It looks at the pattern of improvement and tries to predict whether
/// continuing to train will give meaningful benefits or if the model has already learned as much as
/// it can from the data.
/// 
/// Think of it like watching someone learn a new skill:
/// - At first, they improve quickly (steep learning curve)
/// - Over time, the rate of improvement slows down (flattening curve)
/// - Eventually, they reach a plateau where more practice yields minimal improvement
/// 
/// This class lets you configure how the detector decides when that plateau has been reached,
/// allowing you to automatically stop training at the right time.</para>

    /// This threshold represents the predicted percentage improvement in the error metric if training

    /// if your model has finished learning.

    /// The convergence threshold represents how much improvement we expect to see if training continues.
    /// For example, with the default value of 0.01 (or 1%):
    /// 
    /// - If the detector predicts that continuing to train would improve your model's performance by
    ///   less than 1%, it will suggest stopping because further training isn't worth the time.
    /// - If it predicts an improvement of more than 1%, it will suggest continuing training.
    /// 
    /// You can adjust this value based on your needs:
    /// - Lower values (like 0.001 or 0.1%) make the detector more patient, continuing training until
    ///   even tiny improvements are unlikely. This might give slightly better results but takes longer.
    /// - Higher values (like 0.05 or 5%) make the detector stop training earlier, saving time but
    ///   potentially leaving some performance on the table.
    /// 
    /// The default of 1% is a good balance for most problems, ensuring significant improvements are
    /// captured while avoiding diminishing returns.</para>

    /// - During the first 5 training iterations, the detector will always recommend continuing
    ///   because it doesn't have enough information yet

    /// You might want to increase this value (to 10 or more) for complex models or noisy training

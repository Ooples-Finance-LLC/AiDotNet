/// Configuration options for Neural Network ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models,

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Neural Network ARIMA is a hybrid approach that extends traditional ARIMA models by incorporating
/// neural networks to capture complex nonlinear patterns in time series data. This approach leverages
/// both the statistical foundation of ARIMA for handling linear dependencies, seasonality, and trends,
/// while using neural networks to model nonlinear relationships that traditional ARIMA cannot capture.
/// The resulting model can provide more accurate forecasts for time series with complex patterns,
/// regime shifts, or other nonlinear dynamics that are common in real-world data.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Neural Network ARIMA combines two powerful approaches for predicting future values in a time series:
/// 
/// Imagine you're trying to predict tomorrow's temperature:
/// - ARIMA is like using mathematical formulas that look at recent temperatures and patterns
/// - Neural Networks are like having a smart system that can learn complex relationships from data
/// - Neural Network ARIMA combines both approaches to get better predictions
/// 
/// Traditional ARIMA is good at capturing:
/// - How today's temperature relates to yesterday's (AR - AutoRegressive)
/// - How random fluctuations from previous days affect today (MA - Moving Average)
/// 
/// But it struggles with complex patterns like:
/// - When a cold front arrives, temperatures might drop suddenly but then recover differently than normal
/// - How humidity and cloud cover might interact in non-obvious ways to affect temperature
/// 
/// The neural network part helps capture these complex relationships, while the ARIMA part
/// ensures the basic time patterns are properly handled. This combination often produces
/// better forecasts than either approach alone.
/// 
/// This class lets you configure both the ARIMA components and the neural network that will
/// work together to make predictions.

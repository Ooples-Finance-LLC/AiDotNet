/// Exponential smoothing is a popular forecasting method for time series data that works by applying
/// weighted averages where the weights decrease exponentially as observations get older. This means
/// recent observations have more influence on forecasts than older observations.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Exponential smoothing is like a weighted average that gives more importance
/// to recent data points and less importance to older ones. Imagine predicting tomorrow's temperature:
/// you might care more about today's temperature than what happened two weeks ago. This method works
/// similarly, gradually "forgetting" older data while focusing on newer trends. It's particularly good
/// for data that changes over time and where recent observations are more relevant for prediction.
/// This class lets you configure how quickly the model "forgets" old data and how it handles trends
/// and seasonal patterns.</para>

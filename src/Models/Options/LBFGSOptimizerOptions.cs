/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// L-BFGS is a quasi-Newton optimization method that approximates the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS)
/// algorithm using limited memory. It's particularly effective for optimizing parameters in models with
/// many parameters, as it doesn't need to store the full Hessian matrix. This makes it more memory-efficient
/// than full BFGS while still providing good convergence properties.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> L-BFGS is an advanced optimization algorithm that helps train machine learning
/// models more efficiently than simpler methods like gradient descent.
/// 
/// Think of training a machine learning model as finding the lowest point in a hilly landscape, where the
/// lowest point represents the best model parameters. While basic algorithms like gradient descent simply
/// follow the steepest downhill path, L-BFGS is smarter:
/// 
/// - It remembers information about previous steps to make better decisions about where to go next
/// - It can take larger steps when appropriate, potentially finding the lowest point faster
/// - It requires less memory than some other advanced methods, making it practical for larger models
/// 
/// L-BFGS is particularly useful when:
/// - You have many parameters to optimize (complex models)
/// - You need faster convergence than gradient descent provides
/// - You have limited memory resources compared to what full second-order methods would require
/// 
/// This class lets you configure how L-BFGS behaves during training, including how much history it
/// remembers and how it adjusts its learning rate.</para>

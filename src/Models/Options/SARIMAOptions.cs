/// SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) is a sophisticated time series forecasting model 
/// that extends the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) framework to handle seasonal patterns in data. 
/// It is particularly useful for time series that exhibit both trend and seasonality, such as monthly sales data, 
/// quarterly economic indicators, or daily web traffic with weekly patterns. The model is denoted as 
/// SARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)m, where p, d, q are the non-seasonal parameters (autoregressive order, differencing order, 
/// and moving average order), P, D, Q are the corresponding seasonal parameters, and m is the seasonal period. 
/// This class provides configuration options for all these parameters, allowing fine-tuning of the SARIMA model 
/// to best capture the specific characteristics of the time series being analyzed.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> SARIMA helps predict future values in time series data that has seasonal patterns.
/// 
/// Time series data shows how values change over time, like:
/// - Monthly sales figures
/// - Daily temperature readings
/// - Quarterly company earnings
/// 
/// Many time series have seasonal patterns:
/// - Retail sales spike during holidays
/// - Ice cream consumption increases in summer
/// - Energy usage follows daily and yearly cycles
/// 
/// SARIMA is designed to capture both:
/// - The overall trend in your data
/// - The repeating seasonal patterns
/// 
/// It does this by combining:
/// - Regular ARIMA components that handle short-term patterns and trends
/// - Seasonal components that handle repeating patterns at fixed intervals
///

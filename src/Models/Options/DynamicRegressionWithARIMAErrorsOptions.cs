/// Dynamic Regression with ARIMA Errors (sometimes called RegARIMA) is a hybrid forecasting approach that uses
/// external variables (regressors) to explain the main trend while modeling the residual errors with ARIMA
/// (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) to capture temporal patterns not explained by the regressors.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This is a forecasting method that combines two powerful techniques. First, it uses
/// regression to find relationships between your target variable (what you're trying to predict) and other variables
/// that might influence it (like temperature affecting ice cream sales). Then, it analyzes the errors in that
/// prediction to find patterns over time (like seasonal trends or cycles). By combining both approaches, it often
/// produces more accurate forecasts than either method alone. Think of it as not just predicting based on related
/// factors, but also learning from its own mistakes.</para>

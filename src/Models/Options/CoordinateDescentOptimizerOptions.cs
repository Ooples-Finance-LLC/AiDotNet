/// <para>
/// Coordinate Descent is an optimization technique that minimizes a function by updating one coordinate
/// (or variable) at a time, while keeping all other coordinates fixed. This approach can be effective
/// for problems where optimizing along individual dimensions is easier than optimizing all dimensions
/// simultaneously.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Imagine you're trying to find the lowest point in a valley. Coordinate
/// Descent is like first walking only north/south until you can't go any lower, then switching to only
/// east/west, then back to north/south, and so on. By taking turns moving in different directions, you
/// can eventually reach the bottom of the valley. This approach can be simpler than trying to move in
/// all directions at once.</para>

/// <summary>
/// Configuration options for Moving Average (MA) models, which are used to analyze time series data
/// by modeling the error terms as a linear combination of previous error terms.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The Moving Average (MA) model is a fundamental component in time series analysis and forecasting.
/// Unlike autoregressive (AR) models that express the current value as a function of past values,
/// MA models express the current value as a function of past forecast errors (also called shocks or innovations).
/// This makes MA models particularly effective at capturing short-term, irregular patterns in time series data.
/// The model is defined by its order (q), which determines how many past error terms are included in the model.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A Moving Average (MA) model helps predict future values in a time series
/// (like daily temperatures, stock prices, or website traffic) based on recent unexpected changes or "surprises."
/// 
/// Imagine you're trying to predict tomorrow's temperature:
/// - An MA model doesn't just look at yesterday's actual temperature
/// - Instead, it focuses on the recent "surprises" - the differences between what was predicted and what actually happened
/// - It assumes that these recent surprises contain useful information about what might happen next
/// 
/// For example:
/// - If the weather has been consistently 2 degrees warmer than predicted for the past few days
/// - An MA model would adjust tomorrow's forecast to account for this pattern of surprises
/// 
/// This approach is particularly useful for data that has short-term patterns or fluctuations.
/// This class allows you to configure how the MA model will be built and optimized.

    /// more parameters to be estimated, increasing the risk of overfitting and computational complexity.

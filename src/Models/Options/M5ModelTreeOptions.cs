/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The M5 Model Tree is an extension of decision trees for regression problems, originally proposed by
/// Quinlan. Unlike traditional regression trees that store a constant value at each leaf, M5 Model Trees
/// fit a multivariate linear regression model at each leaf node. This combination allows the algorithm to
/// model both non-linear and linear relationships in the data efficiently. The algorithm includes pruning
/// mechanisms to prevent overfitting and smoothing techniques to improve predictions at the boundaries
/// between different linear models.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> The M5 Model Tree is a powerful algorithm that combines two approaches
/// to make predictions about continuous values (like prices, temperatures, or heights).
/// 
/// Imagine you're trying to predict house prices:
/// - A regular decision tree would divide houses into categories (like "small houses in good neighborhoods")
///   and assign an average price to each category
/// - The M5 Model Tree does something smarter: it divides the houses into categories, but then creates
///   a custom formula for each category
/// 
/// Think of it like this:
/// - First, it groups similar houses together (like a traditional decision tree)
/// - Then, within each group, it creates a formula that considers factors like exact square footage,
///   number of bathrooms, etc. (using linear regression)
/// - This gives you more precise predictions than a simple average for each group
/// 
/// This class allows you to configure how the tree is built, pruned, and how its predictions are smoothed.

/// Configuration options for detecting overfitting, underfitting, and good fitting in machine learning models

/// <para>
/// The CrossValidationFitDetectorOptions class provides threshold settings that help determine whether a model
/// is overfitting (performing well on training data but poorly on validation data), underfitting (performing
/// poorly on both training and validation data), or has a good fit (performing well on both).
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Think of these settings as the criteria for judging how well your AI model has learned.
/// Just like when learning a new skill, an AI can learn too little (underfit), memorize without understanding (overfit),
/// or learn just right (good fit). These thresholds help determine which category your model falls into by comparing
/// how it performs on data it has seen before (training data) versus new data (validation data).</para>

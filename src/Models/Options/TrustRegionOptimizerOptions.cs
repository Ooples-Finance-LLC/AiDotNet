/// <para>
/// Trust Region methods are iterative optimization techniques designed to find local minima or maxima of objective 
/// functions, particularly in nonlinear problems. Unlike line search methods, which determine the step size along 
/// a predefined direction, trust region methods concurrently optimize both the direction and the magnitude of the 
/// step within a specified neighborhood (the "trust region") around the current iterate. The central idea is to 
/// construct a simplified model—often a quadratic approximation—that represents the objective function near the 
/// current point. This model serves as a surrogate, guiding the search for the optimum within a bounded region. 
/// The size of the trust region is dynamically adjusted based on how well the model predicts the actual behavior 
/// of the objective function. This class inherits from GradientBasedOptimizerOptions and adds parameters specific 
/// to Trust Region optimization.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Trust Region methods are like exploring with a map that's only accurate near your current location.
/// 
/// When solving optimization problems:
/// - We often use approximations of the objective function to determine the next step
/// - But these approximations are only reliable within a certain distance
/// 
/// Trust Region methods solve this by:
/// - Creating a simplified model of the function around the current point
/// - Defining a "trust region" where this model is considered reliable
/// - Finding the best step within this region
/// - Adjusting the region size based on how well the model predicts actual function behavior
/// 
/// This approach offers several benefits:
/// - More robust than many other methods, especially for difficult problems
/// - Handles non-convex functions well
/// - Can make progress even when the Hessian is not positive definite
/// - Naturally limits step sizes to prevent erratic behavior
/// 
/// This class lets you configure how the Trust Region algorithm behaves.

    /// This property specifies the convergence tolerance for the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method, which is commonly 
    /// used to solve the trust region subproblem (finding the best step within the trust region). The CG method is 
    /// considered to have converged when the residual norm is less than this tolerance. A smaller tolerance requires 
    /// more precise convergence, potentially leading to more accurate solutions to the subproblem but requiring more 
    /// iterations. The default value of 1e-6 (0.000001) provides a relatively strict convergence criterion suitable 
    /// for many applications, ensuring accurate solutions to the subproblem while allowing the algorithm to terminate 
    /// in a reasonable number of iterations. The optimal value depends on the desired precision of the subproblem 
    /// solutions and the computational resources available.
    /// </para>
    /// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This setting determines how precisely the algorithm solves each trust region subproblem.
    /// 
    /// The CG tolerance:
    /// - Defines when the subproblem solver considers itself "done"
    /// - Smaller values require more precise solutions to each subproblem
    /// - Affects both the quality of each step and the computation required
    /// 
    /// The default value of 1e-6 (0.000001) means:
    /// - The subproblem solver stops when the error is very small
    /// - This provides good precision for most applications
    /// 
    /// Think of it like this:
    /// - Smaller values (e.g., 1e-8): More precise subproblem solutions, but may take more iterations
    /// - Larger values (e.g., 1e-4): Faster subproblem solutions, but potentially less optimal steps
    /// 
    /// When to adjust this value:
    /// - Decrease it when you need very precise steps within each trust region
    /// - Increase it when computational efficiency is more important than precision
    /// - For most applications, the default value works well
    /// 
    /// For example, in a scientific computing application requiring high precision,
    /// you might decrease this to 1e-8 for more precise subproblem solutions.

/// <para>
/// Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a probabilistic technique for solving computational problems that can be reduced to finding
/// good paths through graphs. It simulates the behavior of ants seeking a path between their colony and a food source.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Ant Colony Optimization works like real ants finding food. When ants find food, they leave
/// a chemical trail (pheromone) on their way back to the nest. Other ants follow strong trails, making them stronger.
/// Trails that don't lead to food gradually fade away. This algorithm mimics this behavior to solve problems by having
/// virtual "ants" explore possible solutions and leave "trails" on good solutions that guide future searches.
/// It's especially good at finding efficient routes or combinations when there are many possibilities to consider.</para>

/// The AR model is a statistical approach for analyzing and forecasting time series data. It predicts future values
/// based on a linear combination of previous values in the time series.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> An AutoRegressive (AR) model is one of the simplest methods for predicting future values 
/// in a time series (data collected over time, like daily temperatures or monthly sales). It works on the principle that 
/// future values can be predicted by looking at past values. Think of it like predicting tomorrow's weather primarily based 
/// on what the weather has been like for the past few days. Unlike more complex models like ARMA or ARIMA, the AR model 
/// focuses solely on the relationship between current values and previous values, without considering prediction errors 
/// or trends.</para>

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The Precision-Recall Curve Fit Detector assesses model performance using metrics derived from the
/// precision-recall curve, which plots precision against recall at various classification thresholds.
/// Unlike accuracy, which can be misleading for imbalanced datasets, precision and recall metrics provide
/// more meaningful insights into model performance when class distributions are skewed. The Area Under
/// the Precision-Recall Curve (AUC-PR) and F1 Score are combined with customizable weights to produce
/// a composite fitness score. This detector is particularly valuable for applications where false positives
/// and false negatives have different implications, such as fraud detection, medical diagnosis, or anomaly
/// detection. The thresholds and weights configured in this class determine whether a model is considered
/// adequately fitted based on these metrics.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> The Precision-Recall Curve Fit Detector helps evaluate how well your model is performing, especially when you have imbalanced data.
/// 
/// Imagine you're building a system to detect rare events (like fraud):
/// - You might have 1,000 normal transactions for every 1 fraudulent one
/// - A model that always predicts "not fraud" would be 99.9% accurate, but useless!
/// - This is why we need better ways to evaluate models with imbalanced data
/// 
/// Instead of simple accuracy, this detector uses two important metrics:
/// 
/// 1. Precision: When the model predicts something is positive (like fraud), how often is it correct?
///    - High precision means fewer false alarms
///    - Think of it as: "When the model raises an alert, how trustworthy is that alert?"
/// 
/// 2. Recall: Out of all the actual positive cases, how many did the model correctly identify?
///    - High recall means fewer missed cases
///    - Think of it as: "What percentage of fraudulent transactions did the model catch?"
/// 
/// The precision-recall curve shows the trade-off between these metrics at different thresholds.
/// This class lets you configure how the detector evaluates model quality based on these metrics.

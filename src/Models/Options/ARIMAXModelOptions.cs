/// ARIMAX extends the ARIMA model by incorporating external (exogenous) variables that may influence the time series.

/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> ARIMAX is like ARIMA (which predicts future values based on past patterns) but with an 
/// added superpower: it can also consider outside factors that might affect your data. For example, when predicting 
/// ice cream sales, ARIMA would only look at past sales patterns, but ARIMAX could also consider temperature data. 
/// Think of it as a weather forecaster who not only looks at past weather patterns but also considers upcoming events 
/// like a hurricane forming in the ocean that will likely affect the forecast.</para>

/// <para>
/// Bootstrap resampling is a statistical technique that creates multiple datasets by randomly sampling with replacement
/// from the original dataset. By training models on these resampled datasets and evaluating their performance,
/// we can assess how well a model generalizes and detect issues like overfitting or underfitting.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> This class contains settings for a tool that helps you determine if your AI model is 
/// working well. It uses a technique called "bootstrapping" - imagine randomly picking data points from your dataset 
/// (sometimes picking the same point multiple times) to create many similar-but-different datasets. By training your 
/// model on these different datasets and seeing how consistent the results are, we can tell if your model is learning 
/// real patterns or just memorizing the training data.</para>

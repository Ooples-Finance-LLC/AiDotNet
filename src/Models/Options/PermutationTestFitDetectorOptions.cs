/// <para>
/// The permutation test is a statistical method used to evaluate model performance by comparing
/// the actual model performance against performance on randomly shuffled (permuted) data. This approach
/// helps determine if the model is truly learning patterns in the data or merely capitalizing on random
/// correlations. By running multiple permutation tests, we can establish statistical confidence in our
/// model's performance and detect common issues like overfitting, underfitting, and high variance.
/// The permutation test is particularly valuable when working with small datasets or when evaluating
/// complex models where traditional validation methods might be insufficient.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> The permutation test fit detector is a tool to check if your AI model is learning properly.
/// 
/// Imagine you're teaching someone to identify birds:
/// - You want them to learn actual bird characteristics (feathers, beak shape, etc.)
/// - Not just memorize the specific pictures you showed them
/// 
/// What this detector does:
/// - It takes your data and randomly shuffles it many times
/// - It checks how your model performs on the shuffled data
/// - It compares this to performance on the real, unshuffled data
/// - If your model only works well on the original arrangement, it's learning real patterns
/// - If it works equally well on random arrangements, it might be "cheating" or guessing
/// 
/// This helps detect three common problems:
/// 1. Overfitting: Your model memorized examples instead of learning general rules
///    (like knowing what a robin looks like only if it's in the exact same pose as your training image)
/// 
/// 2. Underfitting: Your model is too simple to capture the patterns in your data
///    (like only using bird size to identify species, ignoring color, shape, etc.)
/// 
/// 3. High Variance: Your model gives inconsistent results with small data changes
///    (like completely changing its bird identification if the lighting is slightly different)
/// 
/// This class lets you configure different aspects of this testing process.

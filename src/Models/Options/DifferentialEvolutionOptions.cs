/// <para>
/// Differential Evolution is a population-based optimization algorithm that uses vector differences for
/// mutation operations. It's known for its robustness, simplicity, and effectiveness in solving complex
/// optimization problems, especially those with real-valued parameters.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Differential Evolution is like a more sophisticated version of genetic algorithms.
/// Instead of random mutations, it creates new solutions by calculating the difference between existing solutions
/// and using that difference to guide the search. Think of it as learning from the "distance" between good solutions
/// to find even better ones. It's particularly good at finding optimal values for problems with continuous variables
/// (like finding the best temperature, pressure, or other numeric values).</para>

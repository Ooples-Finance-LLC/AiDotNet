/// <para>
/// The BFGS algorithm is a quasi-Newton method for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems.
/// It approximates the Hessian matrix (which contains second derivatives) using gradient information,
/// making it more efficient than methods that require explicit computation of the Hessian.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> BFGS is an advanced optimization algorithm that helps find the best solution 
/// to a problem efficiently. Think of it like finding the lowest point in a hilly landscape when you can only 
/// see the steepness at your current position. Unlike simpler methods that just go downhill, BFGS builds a 
/// "mental map" of the landscape as it explores, helping it make smarter decisions about where to go next. 
/// This makes it faster and more reliable for complex problems.</para>

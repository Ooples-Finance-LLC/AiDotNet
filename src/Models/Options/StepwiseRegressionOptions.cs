/// Stepwise Regression is an automated approach to building regression models by iteratively adding or removing 
/// predictor variables based on their statistical significance. This technique helps identify the most important 
/// features while excluding those that contribute little to the model's predictive power, resulting in more 
/// parsimonious and potentially more interpretable models. There are several variants of stepwise regression, 
/// including forward selection (starting with no predictors and adding them one by one), backward elimination 
/// (starting with all predictors and removing them one by one), and bidirectional elimination (a combination of 
/// both approaches). This class provides configuration options for controlling the stepwise regression process, 
/// including the selection method, constraints on the number of features, and criteria for determining when to 
/// stop adding or removing features.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Stepwise Regression helps automatically select the most important variables for your model.
/// 
/// When building a regression model:
/// - You often have many potential predictor variables
/// - Not all variables are equally useful
/// - Including too many variables can lead to overfitting
/// - Including too few might miss important relationships
/// 
/// Stepwise regression solves this by:
/// - Systematically testing different combinations of variables
/// - Adding or removing variables one at a time
/// - Keeping only those that significantly improve the model
/// - Stopping when further changes don't help much
/// 
/// This approach helps you:
/// - Identify which variables actually matter
/// - Create simpler, more interpretable models
/// - Avoid the computational cost of unnecessary variables
/// - Potentially improve prediction accuracy
/// 
/// This class lets you configure exactly how the stepwise selection process works.

/// State Space Models (SSMs) are a flexible class of time series models that represent the dynamics of a system 
/// through hidden states and observable outputs. They provide a unified framework for modeling various time series 
/// patterns, including trends, seasonality, and cycles. The core of a state space model consists of two equations: 
/// a state equation that describes how the hidden state evolves over time, and an observation equation that relates 
/// the hidden state to the observed data. Common examples of state space models include the Kalman Filter, 
/// Hidden Markov Models, and structural time series models. This class provides configuration options for state 
/// space models, including the dimensions of the state and observation vectors, learning parameters for model 
/// estimation, and convergence criteria. These options allow customization of the model complexity and fitting 
/// process to match the specific characteristics of the time series being analyzed.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> State Space Models help analyze time series data by tracking hidden variables that influence observable measurements.
/// 
/// In many real-world systems:
/// - We can only measure certain outputs (like temperature, price, or position)
/// - But these measurements are influenced by hidden internal states
/// - State Space Models help us track these hidden states over time
/// 
/// For example, in tracking a moving object:
/// - We might only observe its position at certain times (observations)
/// - But its velocity and acceleration are hidden states that affect future positions
/// - A state space model can estimate these hidden states from the observations
/// 
/// These models are powerful because they:
/// - Handle noisy measurements
/// - Can incorporate multiple influencing factors
/// - Provide a framework for forecasting future values
/// - Work well with missing data
/// 
/// Common applications include:
/// - Economic forecasting
/// - Object tracking in computer vision
/// - Signal processing
/// - Financial time series analysis
/// 
/// This class lets you configure the structure and training process for state space models.

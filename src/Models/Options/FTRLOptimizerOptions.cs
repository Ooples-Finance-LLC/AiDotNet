/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// FTRL (Follow-The-Regularized-Leader) is an optimization algorithm developed by Google that combines
/// the benefits of Adaptive Gradient (AdaGrad) for sparse data and Regularized Dual Averaging (RDA) for
/// better regularization. It's particularly effective for large-scale linear models and online learning
/// scenarios where data arrives sequentially.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Think of FTRL as a smart learning algorithm that adjusts how quickly your
/// model learns based on past experience. Unlike simpler optimizers that use the same learning approach
/// for all features, FTRL can learn different features at different rates. This makes it especially good
/// for data where many inputs might be zero or missing (called "sparse data"), like text analysis where
/// most words don't appear in most documents. FTRL was developed by Google and has been particularly
/// successful for online advertising and recommendation systems where models need to update continuously
/// as new data arrives.</para>

/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Extremely Randomized Trees (also known as Extra Trees) is an ensemble learning method that extends
/// Random Forests by introducing additional randomization in the way splits are computed. While Random Forests
/// search for the optimal split among a random subset of features, Extra Trees select random splits for each
/// feature and choose the best among those. This additional randomization helps reduce variance and often
/// improves generalization.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Extremely Randomized Trees is like having a large committee of decision-makers
/// (trees) who each look at your data in a slightly different, randomized way. Imagine asking 100 people to
/// help you decide whether to buy a house, but each person can only consider a random subset of factors
/// (like price, location, size) and must make quick decisions without overthinking. By averaging all their
/// opinions, you often get better advice than from just one person or from a committee that all thinks the
/// same way. This randomness helps the model avoid focusing too much on specific patterns that might just be
/// coincidences in your training data.</para>

    /// of just one. More trees usually give more stable and accurate predictions (like how asking more people
    /// gives you a more reliable consensus), but they also make the model slower to train and use more memory.

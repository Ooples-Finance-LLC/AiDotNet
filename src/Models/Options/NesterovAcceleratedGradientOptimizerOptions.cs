/// Configuration options for the Nesterov Accelerated Gradient optimization algorithm, a momentum-based
/// technique that improves convergence speed in gradient descent optimization.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) is an enhancement to standard gradient descent optimization that 
/// incorporates momentum with a look-ahead approach. By evaluating gradients at a position estimated 
/// by the momentum term rather than the current position, NAG provides better responsiveness to changes 
/// in the error surface. This results in faster convergence rates and improved performance, particularly 
/// in problems with high curvature or narrow valleys in the error surface. The algorithm adaptively 
/// adjusts both learning rate and momentum during training to optimize performance.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Nesterov Accelerated Gradient is a technique that helps AI models learn faster and better.
/// 
/// Imagine you're trying to find the lowest point in a valley by walking downhill:
/// - Regular gradient descent is like always taking a step directly downhill from where you stand
/// - Adding momentum is like rolling a ball downhill - it picks up speed and can go faster
/// - Nesterov adds a clever twist: it looks ahead in the direction the ball is rolling before deciding which way is downhill
/// 
/// This "look-ahead" approach helps the model:
/// - Learn faster in most situations
/// - Avoid overshooting the best solution
/// - Navigate tricky terrain in the learning landscape
/// - Adapt to different types of problems
/// 
/// The settings in this class let you control:
/// - How quickly the learning rate and momentum can increase when things are going well
/// - How quickly they decrease when progress slows down
/// 
/// This adaptive behavior helps the model automatically find efficient settings as it learns,
/// rather than requiring you to find the perfect fixed values upfront.

    /// but without any of the data filled in. The new model has the same:
    /// - Number of centers
    /// - Gamma parameter (controls how quickly the influence of each center drops off)
    /// - Regularization settings
    /// - Other configuration options

    /// But it doesn't have the learned centers or weights from training.

    /// cross-validation or creating ensembles of similar models.

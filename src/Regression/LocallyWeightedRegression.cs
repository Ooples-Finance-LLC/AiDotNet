/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Locally Weighted Regression (LWR) is a memory-based, non-parametric method that creates a unique model
/// for each prediction point. Unlike global regression methods that find a single model for all data,
/// LWR fits a separate weighted regression model for each query point, giving higher influence to
/// nearby training examples. This approach provides excellent flexibility for modeling complex, nonlinear
/// relationships without specifying a fixed functional form.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Locally Weighted Regression is like having a personalized prediction for each point.
/// 
/// Instead of creating a single model for all data (like linear regression does), LWR:
/// - Creates a new, custom model for each prediction point you want to estimate
/// - Gives more importance to training examples that are close to your prediction point
/// - Gives less importance to training examples that are far away
/// 
/// Imagine predicting house prices: When estimating the price of a specific house, LWR would:
/// - Give most influence to similar houses in the same neighborhood
/// - Give moderate influence to somewhat similar houses in nearby areas
/// - Give little or no influence to very different houses in distant locations
/// 
/// This approach is flexible and works well for complex patterns, but requires keeping all training
/// data around for making predictions, which can be computationally intensive for large datasets.

/// <para>
/// Robust regression provides an alternative to traditional regression methods when data contains 
/// outliers or influential observations. By using weight functions, it reduces the influence of outliers 
/// on the final model. This implementation uses an iterative reweighted least squares approach to 
/// estimate coefficients that are less affected by extreme values.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Traditional regression models can be heavily influenced by outliers 
/// (unusual data points that don't follow the general pattern). 
/// 
/// Think of robust regression like a smart voting system:
/// - It identifies which data points are "suspicious" (potential outliers)
/// - It gives these points less influence (lower weight) in determining the final model
/// - It focuses more on the reliable data points to find the true pattern
/// 
/// For example, if most houses in a neighborhood cost $200,000-300,000, but one special mansion costs 
/// $2 million, robust regression would recognize this as an outlier and reduce its influence when 
/// predicting house prices based on size or features.

/// Implements spline regression, which models nonlinear relationships by fitting piecewise polynomial functions.
/// This advanced regression technique offers more flexibility than simple linear regression by allowing the model

/// <typeparam name="T">The numeric type used for calculations (typically float or double).</typeparam>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Spline regression uses basis functions centered at specific points called knots. The model combines:
/// - A constant term
/// - Polynomial terms of the input features (up to a specified degree)
/// - Spline terms that activate beyond each knot
///
/// This creates a piecewise function that can smoothly adapt to local patterns in the data.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Spline regression is like drawing a curve through your data that can bend and adjust
/// at specific points (called knots).
/// 
/// Think of it like this:
/// - Instead of forcing a single straight line through all your data
/// - The model places connection points (knots) where the curve can change direction
/// - These knots let the model adapt to different patterns in different regions of your data
/// 
/// For example, if modeling how temperature affects plant growth:
/// - Below freezing: plants don't grow at all (flat line)
/// - From freezing to optimal: growth increases rapidly (steep curve)
/// - Above optimal: growth slows again (flatter curve)
/// 
/// A spline regression can capture these changing relationships much better than a simple line.

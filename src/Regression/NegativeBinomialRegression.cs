/// <para>
/// Negative binomial regression is a type of generalized linear model used for modeling count data when the variance
/// exceeds the mean (overdispersion), which violates the assumption of Poisson regression. It extends Poisson regression
/// by adding a dispersion parameter that accounts for the extra variance in the data. The model uses a log link function
/// to ensure that predictions are always positive, as required for count data.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Negative binomial regression is a special model for predicting counts when your data shows more variation than expected.
/// 
/// Think of it like predicting the number of customer service calls a business receives each day:
/// - A simple model might assume consistent variation around the average (Poisson model)
/// - But real data often shows much more variation - some days have way more calls than expected
/// - Negative binomial regression handles this "extra randomness" by including a special adjustment (dispersion parameter)
/// 
/// For example, the model might predict that a business receives 15 calls per day on average, but also accounts for the fact
/// that some days might have 5 calls while others have 40, which is more extreme variation than simpler models would expect.

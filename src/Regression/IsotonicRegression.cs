/// <para>
/// Isotonic Regression is a form of nonlinear regression that fits a non-decreasing function to data.
/// Unlike many regression techniques, it makes minimal assumptions about the shape of the function
/// besides monotonicity (that the function doesn't decrease as the input increases). This makes it
/// particularly useful for calibrating probability estimates from other models or for situations where
/// a monotonic relationship is expected between the input and output variables.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Isotonic Regression creates a "stair-step" function that only goes up, never down.
/// 
/// Imagine you're drawing a line through points on a graph, but with two key rules:
/// - The line can go up or stay flat, but it can never go down
/// - The line should stick as close as possible to all the data points
/// 
/// This model is useful when you know that as one value increases, the other should never decrease.
/// For example:
/// - As study time increases, test scores shouldn't decrease
/// - As price increases, demand shouldn't increase
/// - As age increases, height (for children) shouldn't decrease
/// 
/// Unlike a straight line (linear regression), Isotonic Regression can capture more complex relationships
/// while still maintaining this "never decreasing" property.

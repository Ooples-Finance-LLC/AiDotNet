/// Simple linear regression models the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation:
/// y = mx + b
/// where:
/// - y is the predicted output value
/// - x is the input feature value
/// - m is the slope (coefficient)
/// - b is the y-intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis)
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> Simple linear regression is like drawing the best straight line through a set of points.
/// 
/// Think of it like this:
/// - You have data points on a graph (like house sizes and their prices)
/// - You want to find the line that best represents the relationship
/// - This line helps you predict new values (like the price of a house based on its size)
/// 
/// For example, if you plot people's heights and weights, simple regression would find
/// the line that shows how weight typically increases with height, allowing you to
/// estimate someone's weight if you only know their height.

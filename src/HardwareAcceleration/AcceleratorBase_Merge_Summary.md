# AcceleratorBase Merge Summary

## Overview
Successfully merged AcceleratorBase.cs and AcceleratorBaseV2.cs into a single unified AcceleratorBase.cs file.

## Changes Made

### 1. Merged AcceleratorBase.cs
- Combined the best features from both versions
- Removed all generic constraints as requested by the user
- Kept memory management features from original AcceleratorBase
- Maintained cleaner interface implementation from AcceleratorBaseV2
- All abstract properties now have `protected set` accessors

### 2. Updated Derived Classes
- **CUDAAcceleratorV2**: Updated to inherit from AcceleratorBase
  - Fixed property overrides (DeviceName, DeviceMemoryBytes, ComputeCapability)
  - Removed duplicate method implementations
  - Added all missing abstract method implementations
  
- **DirectMLAccelerator**: Updated to inherit from AcceleratorBase
  - Fixed property overrides (DeviceName, DeviceMemoryBytes, ComputeCapability)
  - Updated field references from _adapterName to DeviceName
  
- **MetalAccelerator**: Updated to inherit from AcceleratorBase
  - Fixed property overrides (DeviceName, DeviceMemoryBytes, ComputeCapability)
  - Added DeviceName initialization
  
- **CUDAAccelerator**: Already correctly implemented with proper property names

### 3. Removed Files
- AcceleratorBaseV2.cs (no longer needed)

## Key Properties in Unified AcceleratorBase

1. **Abstract Properties** (must be implemented by derived classes):
   - `AcceleratorType Type`
   - `string DeviceName { get; protected set; }`
   - `bool IsAvailable`
   - `long DeviceMemoryBytes { get; protected set; }`
   - `ComputeCapability ComputeCapability { get; protected set; }`

2. **Implemented Properties** (provided by base class):
   - `string Name` => Returns DeviceName
   - `int DeviceId` => Returns _currentDeviceId
   - `long TotalMemory` => Returns DeviceMemoryBytes
   - `long AvailableMemory` => Calculated from DeviceMemoryBytes - _allocatedMemory

## Result
All accelerator classes now inherit from a single, unified AcceleratorBase class that provides consistent functionality across all hardware acceleration implementations.

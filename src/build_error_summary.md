## Key Issues

1. **CS1061 (1,132 errors)**: Missing method/property definitions - likely due to interface changes or incomplete implementations
2. **CS8618 (930 errors)**: Non-nullable reference type issues - properties not initialized
3. **CS0117 (404 errors)**: Static members not found - possibly removed or renamed
4. **CS1503 (242 errors)**: Type conversion issues - method signatures may have changed

## Areas Successfully Fixed

- **OnlineLearning**: All 75 errors fixed ✓
- **AdaptiveOnlineModelBase**: CS8604 errors fixed ✓
- **PredictionModelBuilder**: Nullable reference errors fixed ✓

## Next Steps

The highest priority areas to fix are:
1. ProductionMonitoring (1,068 errors)
2. Deployment (564 errors)
3. FoundationModels (538 errors)
4. NeuralNetworks (466 errors)

Most errors appear to be related to:
- Missing or changed interface definitions
- Non-nullable reference type issues
- Method signature changes

/// <b>For Beginners:</b>
/// Biorthogonal wavelets are special mathematical tools that offer more flexibility than standard wavelets.
/// 
/// The key difference is that biorthogonal wavelets use:
/// - One set of functions to break down (decompose) a signal
/// - A different but related set of functions to rebuild (reconstruct) it
/// 
/// This approach offers several advantages:
/// - Perfect reconstruction: The signal can be rebuilt exactly without errors
/// - Symmetry: The wavelets can be symmetric, which reduces edge artifacts
/// - Linear phase: Important for preserving the shape of features in the signal
/// 
/// These properties make biorthogonal wavelets particularly useful for:
/// - Image compression (JPEG2000 uses them)
/// - Signal denoising where preserving edges is important
/// - Applications where phase information matters
/// 
/// You can think of biorthogonal wavelets as using two complementary lenses - one for analyzing
/// and one for synthesizing - that work together perfectly.

    /// 
    /// 1. Normalization: It adjusts the coefficients so that their energy (sum of squares)
    ///    equals 1. This ensures that the wavelet transform preserves the energy of the signal.
    /// 
    /// 2. Type conversion: It converts the double-precision coefficients to the generic
    ///    numeric type T used by the class.
    /// 
    /// Normalization is important because it ensures that the wavelet transform doesn't
    /// artificially amplify or reduce the signal's energy. It's a standard practice in
    /// wavelet design to ensure consistent results regardless of the specific wavelet used.

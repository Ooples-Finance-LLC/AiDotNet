/// B-spline wavelets are like smooth, bell-shaped curves that can be used to analyze signals at
/// different levels of detail.
/// 
/// Key features of B-spline wavelets:
/// - They're very smooth (no sharp corners or discontinuities)
/// - They have compact support (affect only a limited region)
/// - Their smoothness increases with the order
/// 
/// Think of B-splines as building blocks that can be combined to create smooth curves.
/// Higher-order B-splines are smoother but have wider support (affect more neighboring points).
/// 
/// These wavelets are particularly useful for:
/// - Signal smoothing and denoising
/// - Feature extraction where smoothness is important
/// - Applications where derivatives of the signal are analyzed
/// - Image processing tasks requiring high regularity

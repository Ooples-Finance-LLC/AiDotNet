/// Implements the Rectangular window function (also known as the boxcar or Dirichlet window) for signal processing applications.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The Rectangular window is the simplest window function, defined by the equation:
/// w(n) = 1 for all n
/// where n is the sample index. Unlike other window functions, the Rectangular window does not
/// taper or modify the signal at the edges, which can lead to spectral leakage in frequency analysis.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A window function is like a special filter that helps analyze signals more accurately.
/// 
/// The Rectangular window:
/// - Is the simplest window function - it has a value of 1 for all points
/// - Does not taper the signal at the edges like other windows do
/// - Preserves the original amplitude of the signal at all points
/// 
/// Think of it like looking at your data through a simple rectangular frame with sharp edges.
/// While this window preserves the most signal energy, the abrupt transitions at the edges can
/// create artifacts in frequency analysis. It's like suddenly turning a speaker on and off instead
/// of gradually adjusting the volume - the sudden change creates additional frequency components
/// that weren't in the original signal.
/// </para>
/// </remarks>

    /// - Every position gets the same value: 1.0

    /// window value, which is always 1), the data remains unchanged. This preserves all the original
    /// information but can lead to spectral leakage - unwanted frequency artifacts that appear when
    /// analyzing a limited segment of a longer signal. The Rectangular window is often used as a baseline
    /// for comparing other window functions or when processing needs to preserve all signal energy.

/// Implements the Triangular window function for signal processing applications.

/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The Triangular window is a simple window function that creates a triangular shape. It is defined by the equation:
/// w(n) = 1 - |2n - L|/L
/// where n is the sample index and L is (windowSize - 1). The Triangular window provides moderate spectral leakage
/// reduction compared to the Rectangular window.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A window function is like a special filter that helps analyze signals more accurately.
/// 
/// The Triangular window:
/// - Creates a simple triangle shape that peaks in the middle
/// - Starts at 0, rises linearly to 1 at the center, then decreases linearly back to 0
/// - Provides a basic improvement over the Rectangular window for reducing spectral leakage
/// 
/// Think of it like a ramp that gradually increases and then decreases - like a mountain peak.
/// When analyzing frequencies in a signal, this gradual transition helps reduce some of the
/// unwanted artifacts that occur with the Rectangular window's abrupt edges. It's like turning
/// a volume knob smoothly up and down instead of suddenly flipping a switch, which creates
/// fewer distortions in the analysis.

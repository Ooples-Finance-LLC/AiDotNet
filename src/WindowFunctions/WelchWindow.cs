/// <para>
/// The Welch window is a parabolic window function defined by the equation:
/// w(n) = 1 - ((n - N/2)/(N/2))²
/// where n is the sample index and N is (windowSize - 1). The Welch window has a parabolic shape
/// that reaches 1 at the center and 0 at both ends.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A window function is like a special filter that helps analyze signals more accurately.
/// 
/// The Welch window:
/// - Creates a smooth parabolic (bowl-shaped) curve
/// - Reaches a maximum value of 1 at the center and tapers to 0 at both ends
/// - Provides good frequency resolution with moderate side lobe suppression
/// 
/// Think of the Welch window like a smooth hill that gradually rises from the edges to the center.
/// Named after Peter Welch, who developed it for power spectrum estimation, this window is particularly 
/// useful when analyzing signals for their frequency content. The parabolic shape provides a good 
/// balance between preserving the main frequency components while reducing unwanted artifacts in the analysis.

/// Implements the Bartlett window function (triangular window) for signal processing applications.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The Bartlett window is a triangular window function that provides a simple approach to smoothing signals.
/// It is defined by the equation: w(n) = 1 - |2(n - (N-1)/2)/(N-1)|
/// where n is the sample index and N is the window size.
/// The Bartlett window has a value of 0 at both endpoints and a value of 1 at the center.
/// </para>
/// <para><b>For Beginners:</b> A window function is like a special filter that smooths out a signal.
/// 
/// The Bartlett window specifically creates a triangle shape:
/// - It starts at 0 at the beginning
/// - Increases to 1 at the middle
/// - Decreases back to 0 at the end
/// 
/// This window is useful when you need to:
/// - Analyze frequencies in audio or other signals
/// - Reduce sharp transitions at the edges of your data
/// - Apply a simple, computationally efficient smoothing effect
/// 
/// For example, if you're analyzing sound and want to focus on a specific time segment,
/// the Bartlett window helps blend the edges smoothly instead of creating an abrupt cutoff.

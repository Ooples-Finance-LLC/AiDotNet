/// Time series data is information collected over time in sequence (like daily temperatures, monthly sales, 
/// or hourly website traffic). When working with time series data, we need special techniques because:
/// 
/// 1. The order of data matters (unlike regular data where order doesn't matter)
/// 2. Recent data is often more important than older data
/// 3. There might be patterns that repeat over time (like seasonal patterns)
/// 
/// This detector analyzes your model's performance and tells you if it's:
/// - Learning too much detail from your data (overfitting)
/// - Not learning enough patterns (underfitting)
/// - Performing inconsistently (high variance)
/// - Working well (good fit)
/// - Behaving unpredictably (unstable)
/// 
/// It also provides specific recommendations to improve your model based on these findings.

/// <summary>
/// Defines the core functionality for time series prediction models.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Time series models analyze sequential data points collected over time to identify patterns
/// and make predictions about future values.
/// 
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> A time series model helps you predict future values based on past data that
/// was collected in sequence over time. For example:
/// 
/// - Predicting tomorrow's temperature based on weather patterns from the past week
/// - Forecasting next month's sales based on previous months' sales data
/// - Estimating website traffic for next week based on historical visitor counts
/// 
/// These models look for patterns in your historical data (like trends, seasonal effects, and cycles)
/// to make educated guesses about what will happen next.
/// 
/// This interface inherits from IModelSerializer, which means these models can be saved to disk
/// and loaded back later - useful for when you've trained a good model and want to use it again
/// without retraining.
/// </remarks>
/// <typeparam name="T">The numeric data type used for calculations (e.g., float, double).</typeparam>

    /// This method measures how well the model's predictions match actual values on data it hasn't seen during training.
    /// 
    /// <b>For Beginners:</b> This method helps you check how accurate your model is. You provide:
    /// 
    /// - xTest: Input data that the model hasn't seen during training
    /// - yTest: The actual correct values for those inputs
    /// 
    /// The method will:
    /// 1. Use your model to make predictions for xTest
    /// 2. Compare those predictions to the actual values in yTest
    /// 3. Calculate various error metrics to tell you how close the predictions were
    /// 
    /// Common metrics include:
    /// - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The average size of the errors
    /// - Mean Squared Error (MSE): Similar to MAE but penalizes large errors more
    /// - R-squared: How much of the variation in the data is explained by the model
    /// 
    /// Lower error values and higher R-squared values generally indicate a better model.
    /// </remarks>
    /// <param name="xTest">The matrix of input features for testing.</param>
    /// <param name="yTest">The vector of actual target values corresponding to xTest.</param>
    /// <returns>A dictionary of evaluation metrics with metric names as keys and metric values as values.</returns>

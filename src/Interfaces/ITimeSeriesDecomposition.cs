/// Defines methods and properties for decomposing time series data into its component parts.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Time series decomposition breaks down a sequence of data points into underlying patterns
/// such as trend, seasonality, and residual components.
/// 
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> Time series decomposition is like taking apart a complex signal (like sales data
/// over time) into simpler pieces that are easier to understand. Imagine your store's sales
/// throughout the year - decomposition helps you separate:
/// 
/// - The overall growth trend (are sales generally increasing?)
/// - Seasonal patterns (higher sales during holidays?)
/// - Day-to-day random variations
/// 
/// This makes it easier to understand what's really happening in your data and make better predictions.
/// </remarks>
/// <typeparam name="T">The numeric data type used for calculations (e.g., float, double).</typeparam>

    /// <b>For Beginners:</b> This is simply your original data - the sequence of values over time
    /// that you wanted to analyze. For example, if you're analyzing daily temperature readings,
    /// this would be your complete list of temperature values in chronological order.

    /// This method returns all the extracted components from the time series.
    /// 
    /// <b>For Beginners:</b> This gives you all the pieces that make up your data, organized by type.
    /// Common components include:
    /// 
    /// - Trend: The long-term direction (going up, down, or staying flat)
    /// - Seasonality: Regular patterns that repeat (like higher sales every weekend)
    /// - Cycle: Longer patterns that don't have a fixed frequency
    /// - Residual/Noise: The random variations that don't fit any pattern
    /// 
    /// Each component helps you understand a different aspect of what's happening in your data.

    /// increase during holidays), you would use this method to get just that piece.

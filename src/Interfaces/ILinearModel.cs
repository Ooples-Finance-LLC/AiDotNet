/// <summary>
/// Defines an interface for linear models in machine learning, which predict outputs as a weighted sum of inputs plus an optional constant.
/// </summary>
/// <typeparam name="T">The numeric type used for calculations (e.g., double, float).</typeparam>
/// <remarks>
/// For Beginners: This interface represents the simplest and most fundamental type of machine learning model.
/// 
/// Imagine you're trying to predict house prices based on features like:
/// - Square footage
/// - Number of bedrooms
/// - Age of the house
/// 
/// A linear model works like this:
/// - Each feature gets assigned a "weight" (coefficient) that represents its importance
/// - For example: Each square foot might add $100 to the price
/// - Each bedroom might add $15,000 to the price
/// - Each year of age might subtract $500 from the price
/// - There might also be a "starting price" (intercept) of $50,000
/// 
/// To make a prediction, the model:
/// 1. Multiplies each feature by its weight
/// 2. Adds all these values together
/// 3. Adds the intercept (if there is one)
/// 
/// So for a 2,000 sq ft, 3-bedroom, 10-year-old house:
/// Price = $50,000 + (2,000 × $100) + (3 × $15,000) + (10 × -$500)
/// Price = $50,000 + $200,000 + $45,000 - $5,000
/// Price = $290,000
/// 
/// Linear models are popular because they're:
/// - Simple to understand
/// - Fast to train
/// - Easy to interpret (you can see exactly how each feature affects the prediction)
/// - Often surprisingly effective despite their simplicity
/// </remarks>

    /// <remarks>
    /// For Beginners: These are the numbers that determine how important each input feature is to your prediction.

    /// In our house price example:

    /// that feature influences the prediction.

    /// For example, a house with zero square footage doesn't make sense, but the model still needs
    /// to produce reasonable values.

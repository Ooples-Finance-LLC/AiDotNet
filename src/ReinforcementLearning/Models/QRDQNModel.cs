/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// QR-DQN is a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm that models the entire distribution
/// of returns rather than just the expected value. By estimating quantiles of the return distribution,
/// it provides a much richer representation of uncertainty and risk, which is particularly valuable
/// for financial market applications.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b>
/// Traditional reinforcement learning models try to predict the average future reward for each action.
/// QR-DQN goes beyond this by predicting the entire range of possible outcomes. This is like the
/// difference between:
/// 
/// - A weather forecast that just says "70% chance of rain tomorrow"
/// - A forecast that tells you "10% chance of no rain, 20% chance of light rain, 40% chance of
///   moderate rain, 20% chance of heavy rain, 10% chance of thunderstorms"
/// 
/// For financial markets, this detailed distribution information is crucial because:
/// - It captures the risk and uncertainty of different trading actions
/// - It can identify strategies with similar average returns but very different risk profiles
/// - It allows for risk-aware decision making that considers potential downside
/// - It can better handle the complex, non-normal distributions common in financial returns
/// </para>

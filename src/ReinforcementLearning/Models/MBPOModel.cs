/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Model-Based Policy Optimization is a hybrid model-based/model-free reinforcement learning
/// algorithm that learns a model of the environment dynamics and uses it to generate synthetic
/// experiences to augment real experiences. This improves sample efficiency and accelerates
/// learning compared to purely model-free approaches.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b>
/// MBPO combines two powerful approaches to reinforcement learning:
/// 
/// 1. It builds a "simulator" of how financial markets behave (model-based)
/// 2. It uses this simulator to generate thousands of synthetic trading scenarios
/// 3. It trains a trading strategy using both real market data and simulated data
/// 
/// This hybrid approach gives you the best of both worlds:
/// - Fast learning like model-based methods (needs less real market data)
/// - Reliable performance like model-free methods (doesn't rely too heavily on the simulator)
/// 
/// For trading applications, this means you can develop sophisticated strategies with
/// less real-world market interaction, reducing risk during the learning phase.

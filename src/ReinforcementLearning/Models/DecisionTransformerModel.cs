/// - Works with both continuous and discrete action spaces

/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b>
/// The Decision Transformer is a modern approach to reinforcement learning that's 
/// particularly well-suited for financial applications like stock market prediction:
/// 
/// - It "thinks" about trading like completing a sequence - similar to how language models predict words
/// - Instead of learning through trial and error, it learns patterns from historical market data
/// - You can tell it what return you want to achieve, and it will suggest actions to reach that target
/// - It can handle complex, long-term patterns in financial data
/// - It works well with limited data and doesn't require actual market interaction during training
/// 
/// This makes it safer and more practical for financial applications than traditional
/// reinforcement learning approaches.

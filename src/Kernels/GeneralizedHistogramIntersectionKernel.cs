/// <para>
/// The Generalized Histogram Intersection kernel is an extension of the standard Histogram Intersection kernel,
/// which is commonly used in image recognition and classification tasks. It measures similarity by finding
/// the "overlap" between two vectors, with an additional parameter (beta) to control the influence of this overlap.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> A kernel function is a mathematical tool that measures how similar two data points are.
/// The Histogram Intersection kernel is especially useful when your data represents frequencies, counts,
/// or distributions (like histograms in image processing).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Think of this kernel as comparing two histograms (or any two sets of non-negative values) by looking at
/// their overlap. For each pair of corresponding values, it takes the smaller one (the overlap) and adds it
/// to the total similarity. The beta parameter lets you adjust how this overlap is weighted.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This kernel works best when your data contains non-negative values, such as pixel intensities, word frequencies,
/// or other count-based features. It's particularly popular in computer vision and document classification.

/// The Exponential kernel is a radial basis function kernel that decreases exponentially with the
/// distance between data points. It is similar to the Gaussian kernel but uses the L1 norm (Manhattan distance)
/// instead of the L2 norm (Euclidean distance squared).

/// For Beginners: A kernel function is a mathematical tool that measures how similar two data points are.
/// The Exponential kernel is like a "similarity detector" that gives higher values when points are close

/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Think of the Exponential kernel as measuring similarity that fades quickly as points get farther apart.
/// It's like the brightness of a flashlight - very bright up close, but quickly gets dimmer as you move away.
/// Unlike some other kernels, the Exponential kernel never completely reaches zero, though it gets very close
/// for distant points.

/// This kernel is useful when you want a similarity measure that's sensitive to small distances but still

/// <para>
/// The Inverse Multiquadric kernel is a radial basis function kernel that measures similarity
/// based on the distance between points. Unlike the Gaussian kernel, it decreases more slowly
/// as points get farther apart, making it useful for data with long-range dependencies.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> A kernel function is a mathematical tool that measures how similar two data points are.
/// The Inverse Multiquadric kernel is like a "similarity detector" that gives higher values when points
/// are close together and lower values when they're far apart.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Think of this kernel as a "distance translator" - it takes the distance between two points and
/// converts it into a similarity score. Points that are close together get a similarity score close to 1,
/// while points that are far apart get a score closer to 0, but the decrease is more gradual than with
/// some other kernels.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This kernel has a parameter 'c' that controls how quickly the similarity decreases with distance.
/// A larger value of 'c' makes the kernel more "tolerant" of distance, meaning points can be farther
/// apart and still be considered somewhat similar.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The Inverse Multiquadric kernel is often used in machine learning tasks like regression, classification,
/// and interpolation, especially when you want to capture both local and more distant relationships in your data.

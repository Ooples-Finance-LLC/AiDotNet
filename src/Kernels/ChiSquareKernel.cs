/// The Chi-Square kernel is based on the Chi-Square distance, which is particularly effective
/// for histogram data (such as image histograms, text frequency counts, etc.). It is commonly
/// used in computer vision and document classification tasks.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// For Beginners: A kernel function is a mathematical tool that measures how similar two data points are.
/// The Chi-Square kernel is especially good at comparing data that represents counts or frequencies,
/// like how often words appear in documents or how many pixels of each color are in an image.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Think of the Chi-Square kernel as a specialized tool for comparing "how much" of something exists
/// in two different samples. It's particularly sensitive to differences in smaller values, which makes
/// it good at detecting subtle patterns in your data. For example, it might notice that two documents
/// use rare words in similar ways, even if their common words are different.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This kernel works best when your data contains only non-negative values, such as counts,
/// frequencies, or proportions.

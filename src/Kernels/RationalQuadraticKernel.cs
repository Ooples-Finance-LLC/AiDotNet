/// The Rational Quadratic kernel is a similarity measure that behaves like a mixture of
/// Gaussian kernels with different length scales. It's particularly useful for data with
/// patterns occurring at multiple scales.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> A kernel function is a mathematical tool that measures how similar two data points are.
/// The Rational Quadratic kernel is like a "smooth similarity detector" that works well for data
/// with both small and large-scale patterns.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Think of it like this: If you're looking at a landscape, some features are small (like rocks)
/// and some are large (like mountains). The Rational Quadratic kernel can detect similarities
/// at both these scales simultaneously, unlike some other kernels that might focus on just one scale.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The formula for the Rational Quadratic kernel is:
/// k(x, y) = 1 - ||x - y||²/(||x - y||² + c)
/// where:
/// - x and y are the two data points being compared
/// - ||x - y||² is the squared Euclidean distance between them
/// - c is a parameter that controls the kernel's behavior
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Common uses include:
/// - Time series analysis where patterns occur at different time scales
/// - Image processing where features exist at different resolutions
/// - Any data where both local and global patterns are important

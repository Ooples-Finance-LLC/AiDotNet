/// <para>
/// The Generalized T-Student kernel is a kernel function based on the Student's t-distribution.
/// It is particularly useful for handling data with outliers because it decreases more slowly
/// than the Gaussian kernel as points get farther apart.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> A kernel function is a mathematical tool that measures how similar two data points are.
/// The T-Student kernel is like a "similarity detector" that gives higher values when points are close
/// together and lower values when they're far apart, but it's more tolerant of occasional large distances
/// than some other kernels.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Think of this kernel as a "forgiving" similarity measure. While many kernels quickly decide that distant
/// points have almost zero similarity, the T-Student kernel decreases more gradually, still giving some
/// weight to points that are moderately far apart. This makes it useful when your data might contain
/// outliers or when distant points might still have meaningful relationships.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This kernel is particularly valuable in machine learning tasks where robustness to outliers is important,
/// such as in financial data analysis, anomaly detection, or noisy real-world datasets.

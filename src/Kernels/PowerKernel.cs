/// The Power kernel is a negative distance-based kernel that measures how different two data points are,
/// rather than how similar they are. It's sometimes called the "negative distance kernel."
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// For Beginners: A kernel function is a mathematical tool that measures relationships between data points.
/// While most kernels measure similarity (higher values mean more similar points), the Power kernel is special
/// because it measures dissimilarity - higher values (less negative) mean the points are more different from each other.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Think of the Power kernel as a "difference detector" that emphasizes how far apart points are.
/// This can be useful when you want your algorithm to focus on the differences between data points
/// rather than their similarities.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The formula for the Power kernel is:
/// k(x, y) = -||x - y||^d
/// where:
/// - x and y are the two data points being compared
/// - ||x - y|| is the Euclidean distance between them
/// - d is the degree parameter
/// - The negative sign makes this a dissimilarity measure
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Common uses include:
/// - Clustering algorithms where distance is more important than similarity
/// - Outlier detection
/// - Applications where the magnitude of difference matters more than similarity patterns

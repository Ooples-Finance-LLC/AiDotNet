/// <para>
/// The Gaussian kernel, also known as the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, is one of the most widely used
/// kernel functions in machine learning. It measures similarity based on the Euclidean distance between points
/// and transforms this distance using an exponential function.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> A kernel function is a mathematical tool that measures how similar two data points are.
/// The Gaussian kernel is like a "similarity detector" that gives higher values when points are close
/// together and lower values when they're far apart.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Think of the Gaussian kernel as a bell-shaped curve centered on each data point. When you compare two points,
/// the kernel value tells you how much their "bells" overlap. Points that are close together have a lot of
/// overlap (high similarity), while distant points have little overlap (low similarity).
/// </para>

/// This kernel is particularly popular because it works well for many different types of data and problems.
/// It's often a good first choice when you're not sure which kernel to use.

/// The Hellinger kernel is based on the Hellinger distance, which is a metric used to quantify the similarity
/// between two probability distributions. This kernel is particularly useful when working with data that
/// represents distributions, such as histograms, word frequencies, or any normalized non-negative data.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> A kernel function is a mathematical tool that measures how similar two data points are.
/// The Hellinger kernel is specifically designed for comparing data that represents probabilities or
/// frequencies (like how often words appear in documents, or the distribution of pixel intensities in images).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Think of this kernel as a "distribution comparator" that works well when your data points represent
/// how things are distributed or how frequently they occur. It's particularly good at handling sparse data
/// (where many values are zero) and is less sensitive to outliers than some other kernels.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This kernel works best when your data contains non-negative values that sum to 1 (or can be normalized
/// to sum to 1), such as probability distributions, normalized histograms, or frequency counts.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Note: For proper use of the Hellinger kernel, input vectors should contain non-negative values and
/// ideally should be normalized (sum to 1). If your data doesn't meet these criteria, you might need
/// to preprocess it before using this kernel.

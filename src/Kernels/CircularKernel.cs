/// For Beginners: A kernel function is a mathematical tool that measures how similar two data points are.
/// The Circular kernel is special because it has a clear "cutoff point" - if two data points are too far

/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Think of the Circular kernel like a neighborhood with a strict boundary. Points inside the neighborhood
/// have varying degrees of similarity based on how close they are to each other. But once you step outside

/// The Laplacian kernel is a radial basis function kernel that uses the Manhattan distance (L1 norm)
/// instead of the Euclidean distance (L2 norm) used by the Gaussian kernel. It's particularly useful
/// for data that has sparse features or when you want to be less sensitive to outliers.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>For Beginners:</b> A kernel function is a mathematical tool that measures how similar two data points are.
/// The Laplacian kernel is like a "similarity detector" that gives higher values when points are close
/// together and lower values when they're far apart.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Think of this kernel as a "distance translator" - it takes the distance between two points and
/// converts it into a similarity score between 0 and 1. Points that are identical get a score of 1,
/// while points that are very different get a score closer to 0.

/// <para>
/// What makes the Laplacian kernel special is how it measures distance - it uses what's called the
/// "Manhattan distance" or "city block distance." Imagine you're in a city with a grid of streets:
/// you can only travel along the streets (not diagonally through buildings). The Manhattan distance
/// is the total number of blocks you'd need to walk. This makes the Laplacian kernel less sensitive
/// to outliers compared to kernels that use the straight-line (Euclidean) distance.
/// </para>

/// The Laplacian kernel is often used in machine learning tasks like classification, regression,
/// and anomaly detection, especially when dealing with high-dimensional or sparse data.

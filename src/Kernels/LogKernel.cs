/// Think of the Log kernel as a "similarity detector" that is very sensitive to small distances but less
/// sensitive to large distances. When two points are very close together, a small change in distance makes
/// a big difference in similarity. But when two points are already far apart, even a large additional
/// distance doesn't change the similarity much.

/// The Log kernel can be useful for data where small differences are very important when points are similar,
